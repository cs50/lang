ZAMYLA CHAN: In the initials problem, we're going to prompt the user for their name and then print their initials. To prompt for the name, we'll use the get string function found in the CS 50 library, and you're allowed to assume that this string will only contain letters and spaces-- so no numbers and no other characters. Then, once you have the string, you'll iterate through. If, say, I was using this program, then I might type my name perfectly-- Zamyla Chan with a capital Z in the beginning, a space, and then a capital C to start my last name. So you'd simply iterate through the string, getting the first character, and then the first character after a space and printing those out. 

But say you had a slightly sloppier user, Milo Banana, who doesn't type in uppercase and might include some extraneous space characters. Well, then when you iterate through the string, you'll have to check to make sure that you're not printing out a space, but rather, his proper initials, capital M, capital B. To print out capital letters, you can use the toupper function. And with that, you finished the problem. 

My name is Z. C., and this was initials.
