00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,590
ZAMYLA CHAN: Hello, world.

3
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,570
My name is Zamyla.

4
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,670
And I will be your walk-through
lead for these CS50 problems.

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,160
In each walk-through, I'll go for
what's required for the problem,

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,360
I'll go over what the
list of to-dos are,

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,840
and I'll provide more of a high-level,
algorithmic way of getting started,

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,050
give you a few hints,
a few snippets of code.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,350
And hopefully, you'll be well on
your way to completing the problem.

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,860
So for today, let's
talk about hello, where

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,930
we're going to write our
very first C program.

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,070
What we need to do is first
navigate to our workspace,

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,530
where we're going to create a
file and save it as hello.c.

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,220
I've already written
a bit of code already.

15
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,060
I've included the standard
io library, and then

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,760
I just created my main function.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,410
What I'm going to do is I'm going
to write printf Hello, world!

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,710
with a backslash n for a nice,
new [INAUDIBLE] formatting,

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,910
and a semicolon to end.

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,260
After saving our program,
let's go to our terminal,

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,430
where we're going to compile it
by typing the command make hello.

22
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,590
It compiles correctly.

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,550
And so we can go ahead and run
our executable file ./hello.

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,900
And there we get Hello, world!

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,880
Hello, world!

26
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,910
My name is Zamyla, and this was hello.

27
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,151
