ZAMYLA CHAN: Hello, world. My name is Zamyla. And I will be your walk-through lead for these CS50 problems. In each walk-through, I'll go for what's required for the problem, I'll go over what the list of to-dos are, and I'll provide more of a high-level, algorithmic way of getting started, give you a few hints, a few snippets of code. And hopefully, you'll be well on your way to completing the problem. So for today, let's talk about hello, where we're going to write our very first C program. What we need to do is first navigate to our workspace, where we're going to create a file and save it as hello.c. I've already written a bit of code already. I've included the standard io library, and then I just created my main function. 

What I'm going to do is I'm going to write printf Hello, world! with a backslash n for a nice, new [INAUDIBLE] formatting, and a semicolon to end. After saving our program, let's go to our terminal, where we're going to compile it by typing the command make hello. It compiles correctly. And so we can go ahead and run our executable file ./hello. 

And there we get Hello, world! Hello, world! My name is Zamyla, and this was hello.
