ZAMYLA CHAN: In the initials problem, we're going to prompt the user for their name and then print the initials from that name. To prompt the user for the name, we'll use the get_string function found in the CS 50 library. 

You're allowed to make two assumptions-- one, that the string will be comprised of only letters and spaces-- so no numbers, no other characters. You're also allowed to assume that there's only going to be a single space between letters, between names. 

So once you have that string, then let's go to print the initials. In this example, say I were to be a perfect user. Then I'd type in my name with a capital Z and a capital C, with a single space in between. So your program would calculate the first letter and then the first letter after a space, and print out ZC. 

But for instance, say Mile Banana is at the keyboard. Well, he might be a little bit sloppier than I am and only type in lowercase letters and include an extra space in front of his first name. But your program should have the same exact output, with a capital MB without any spaces. 

Finally, whenever you've determined the characters to print, make sure that you print them as uppercase using the toupper function. 

My name is ZC, and this was initials.
