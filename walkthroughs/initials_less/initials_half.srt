ZAMYLA CHAN: In the
initials problem, we're

3
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:04,320
going to prompt the user
for their name and then

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,000
print the initials from that name.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,750
To prompt the user for the name,
we'll use the get_string function

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,670
found in the CS 50 library.

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,000
You're allowed to make
two assumptions-- one,

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,010
that the string will be comprised
of only letters and spaces-- so

9
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,152
no numbers, no other characters.

10
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,110
You're also allowed to
assume that there's only

11
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:25,420
going to be a single space
between letters, between names.

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,560
So once you have that string, then
let's go to print the initials.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,740
In this example, say I
were to be a perfect user.

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,040
Then I'd type in my name with
a capital Z and a capital C,

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,940
with a single space in between.

16
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,360
So your program would
calculate the first letter

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,860
and then the first letter after
a space, and print out ZC.

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,710
But for instance, say Mile
Banana is at the keyboard.

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,240
Well, he might be a
little bit sloppier than I

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,890
am and only type in lowercase
letters and include an extra space

21
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,870
in front of his first name.

22
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,890
But your program should
have the same exact output,

23
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:03,440
with a capital MB without any spaces.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,600
Finally, whenever you've
determined the characters to print,

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,360
make sure that you print them as
uppercase using the toupper function.

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,870
My name is ZC, and this was initials.

27
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,482
