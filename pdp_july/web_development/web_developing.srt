00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,040

00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,240
DAVID MALAN: We're back
and today we'll end

3
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,770
with a little bit of web development.

4
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,120
So based on everyone's
experience, sounds

5
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,200
like some folks have a little
bit of experience with this.

6
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,040
So we'll try to fill it in some gaps
and go in any number of directions

7
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,873
that you might like.

8
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:15,080
But ultimately give you a sense of
exactly the next layering on top

9
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,310
of platform-as-a-service,
infrastructure-as-a-service,

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,560
platform-as-a-service, and
now software-as-a-service.

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,510
So a very common thing
for engineers to use

12
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,649
is an IDE, integrated
development environment.

13
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:27,940
This is a piece of software
with which they write code.

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,220
Now, technically speaking,
as we'll see tomorrow,

15
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,740
you don't need anything more
than Notepad or TextEdit

16
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,850
to actually write code.

17
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,880
Because most every coding
language these days is text-based.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
So all you need generally is a
program with which to write it

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,620
and then a program with which to run it.

20
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,750
Cloud9 and in turn CS50 IDE,
which is the web-based tool

21
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,890
we use in the class I
teach during the year,

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,790
is a web-based programming
environment that

23
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,610
gives us all of the
requisite tools that we

24
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,660
might need for any number of languages.

25
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,980
It also gives us a built-in web server,
it will give us a built-in database

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,855
server, although we
won't use that today,

27
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,980
and it gives us the ability
to actually write code,

28
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,890
all within the confines
of a web browser.

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,360
The alternative to this
would be for me to write

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,020
all of a whole bunch of
instructions for how everyone here

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,950
can install their own
web server, whether it's

32
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,542
Apache or IIS, on their own Mac or PC.

33
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,500
And then we're going to run into
different issues of Windows and Mac OS

34
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,850
and all of the litany of
headaches that might happen.

35
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,310
With the web, now, we're just already
up and running and ready to go.

36
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:30,532
So what you'll see before you is
a screen that looks like this.

37
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:32,990
I've maximized mine, so you
might just see a few more icons

38
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,212
and buttons around the way.

39
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:36,420
If you don't see this, call
me over in just a moment.

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,560
And let me orient you
to what's going on here.

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,810
So in the top left-hand corner is your
so-called workspace or file browser.

42
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,580
So as we start to create files,
just like in Windows and Mac OS,

43
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,720
they'll start to appear
there on the left.

44
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,680
In the top right, you'll
see a window where

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,740
we can actually write code ultimately.

46
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,550
And I noticed some of you
might have clicked and dragged

47
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,490
and pulled something like this up,
notice that the workspace windows

48
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,190
can be moved like common software.

49
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,530
But go ahead, and in the window
above, see this little plus up here?

50
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,850
Go ahead and click that.

51
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,560
And you'll see at least two
options, New File and New Terminal.

52
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,990
Click New File and you'll get a little
tab, like a typical editing program.

53
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,450
And that's where we're going
to write ultimately some code,

54
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,000
but more on that in just a moment.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,540
In the bottom right-hand corner,
where you ran update 50 a moment ago,

56
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,990
update 50 is a command that
we, for the course I teach,

57
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,180
wrote that sort of
automatically updates students

58
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,700
workspaces to have the very
latest versions of software.

59
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,060
But even though this thing is positioned
as CS50 IDE, at the end of the day,

60
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,479
this is designed to be and is actually
representative of a real world

61
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,520
development environment
complete with the ability

62
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,040
to browse your file system
or files and directories,

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,580
complete with the ability to
write code in multiple tabs,

64
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,130
and complete with the ability
to run your own server.

65
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,570
Indeed, this blue window here is
what's called a terminal window.

66
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,090
And it's giving you command-line
access-- text-based access

67
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,720
to the underlying operating
system, which in this case

68
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,170
is Linux called Ubuntu 14.04,
which is the version number,

69
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,320
it's a very popular distribution of a
free operating system called Ubuntu.

70
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,030
Moreover, in this environment, you have
what are called super user privileges.

71
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,310
So you can write commands like
sudo, which is substitute user do,

72
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,030
and actually run commands as
though you're administrator.

73
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,260
We won't do that and try not to do
that, lest we break things right now.

74
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,580
But what's powerful about this is
that it gives you and in turn students

75
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,290
more generally the
ability to do anything

76
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,490
they want in a nice sort
of sandbox environment

77
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,940
that's nonetheless representative.

78
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,350
Now you wouldn't typically use Cloud9
in this context with our free accounts

79
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,240
to run your web server,
because the way they

80
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,810
achieve free accounts is that the
service, when you're not using it,

81
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,200
automatically turns off your container.

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,810
What you have access to,
here, is a container.

83
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,220
So you couldn't run
a website 24/7 on it,

84
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,930
but you could if you actually paid
for the sort of monthly plans as well.

85
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,160
Thank you.

86
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,440
So what are we now
going to do with this?

87
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,140
So we're not going to type this up here.

88
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,670
Let me go ahead and
propose the following.

89
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,140
Go ahead and first do this.

90
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,150
Back on your own computer's desktop,
whether it's Mac OS or Windows,

91
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,590
go ahead and open up
TextEdit if you're on a Mac

92
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,071
or open up Notepad.exe
if you're on Windows.

93
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:17,820
If you're not sure how
to find those, just

94
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,120
call me over or ask someone near you.

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,450
But just the simplest
stupidest text editing

96
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,290
programs on both operating systems.

97
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,400
And they're simple insofar as they
really don't do all that much.

98
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,930
Now just as an aside, odds are if
you're using TextEdit on a Mac,

99
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,050
it's actually not as
simple as would be ideal.

100
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,240
Odds are by default,
you are seeing a window

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,440
that looks like this with
a whole font thing up top.

102
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,520
This is bad, this is going to create
not a simple text file for us.

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,160
This is going to create RTF or
rich rich text format, which

104
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
is actually formatted text.

105
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:04,330
So Mac users only, if you wouldn't
mind going to TextEdit Preferences

106
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:09,279
and then change the default format
from Rich Text to Plain Text.

107
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,820
Otherwise you'll be saving the
file in the wrong file format.

108
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,070
And we won't use this for
very long it's meant to just

109
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,490
be demonstrative of the relative
simplicity with which we

110
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,720
can start writing web pages.

111
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,690
So what is a web page?

112
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,212
A web page is written in a language
called HTML, HyperText Markup Language.

113
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:24,670
This is not a programming language.

114
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,640
As you'll see tomorrow, you can't use
HTML to make the computer do something.

115
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,750
You can only use HTML to make the
computer show something, really.

116
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,200
And we'll see what distinguishes
the two by tomorrow.

117
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,330
And HTML is this markup language
that works essentially as follows.

118
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,890
This is perhaps the simplest
web page that you could write.

119
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:48,110
And by that I mean it has only the
minimally required elements for a page.

120
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,410
So this is a page that
apparently is just

121
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,320
going to tell the user hello, world.

122
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,470
But how does it do that?

123
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,952
Well, up top, there is just this
declaration called the document type

124
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:00,660
declaration that frankly you just
kind of have to copy and paste.

125
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,030
It's anomalous, it doesn't look
like anything else exactly.

126
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,300
So you just copy and paste this
to the start of your document.

127
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,830
And this signifies to the browser that's
going to read this file top to bottom,

128
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,590
left to right, hey browser,
this is an HTML page

129
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,890
written in version 5 of the language.

130
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,070
That's just the symbol for 5, it's
not as intuitive as would be ideal.

131
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,510
But they're after-- what's nice about
HTML, is everything follows a pattern.

132
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,680
So you'll notice, and I'll point
to this one as it's closer,

133
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,670
notice the parallelism
between open bracket,

134
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,550
this is the angle bracket
HTML close bracket,

135
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,760
and then notice the opposite of
it, so to speak here at the bottom.

136
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,730
And by opposite I mean if this
is an open tag or a start tag

137
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,060
as we'll call it, this would be
the close tag or the end tag here.

138
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,690
Different only insofar as
there are this forward slash

139
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,980
in front of the same word HTML.

140
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,399
Now, up here is a division of the page
into two sections, the head of the page

141
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,440
and the body of the page.

142
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,860
These are the only two
sections inside of a web page.

143
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,300
The head is really just
the top menu bar space

144
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,800
and the body is 99% of the
page, the so-called viewport.

145
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,180
Big rectangular region where
actual information is presented.

146
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,060
The head of the page, open bracket
head close bracket head, here, for now

147
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,960
contains only one child
element, a title element.

148
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,270
And you might have guessed, this is
how I specify what the title of my page

149
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,320
should be in the menu bar or in
the tab that you see on the page.

150
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,430
Meanwhile, the body
of the page is, again,

151
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,100
the big rectangular region
with which we're all familiar.

152
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,060
The only words there are going
to be apparently hello, world.

153
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,560
So notice that this is kind of
like a tree structure if you will.

154
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,150
It's kind of like a family tree,
whereby if the roots or the patriarch

155
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,850
or matriarch of the family
is this HTML element,

156
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,170
everything else kind
of descends from that.

157
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,724
And we can see that.

158
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:43,390
Can we see that?

159
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,600
No, can't see that here.

160
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,720
We can see that if I draw it.

161
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,070
We can see that we have
an HTML elements that I'll

162
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,140
draw as the root of this family tree.

163
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,370
It has two children so to speak.

164
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,910
So it has the head on the
left, because it came first.

165
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,640
And the body on the right,
because it came second.

166
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,210
Then the head, meanwhile,
has a title child.

167
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,950
And then the title child has
literally the words hello comma world.

168
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,030
The body, now, has how many children?

169
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,420
Seems like just one.

170
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,970
So I'll draw it in quotes
because it's different.

171
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,110
Hello comma world.

172
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,380
So I offer this just as kind of a
different way of thinking about things.

173
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,340
There's this whole hierarchy or
tree structure to a web page.

174
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,310
And that's why we have the
nice pretty indentation.

175
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,900
And how every tag that's opened
is simultaneously closed.

176
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,140
But notice the order, the
first tag to be opened

177
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,070
was HTML, ergo the last tag
to be closed should be a HTML.

178
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,289
There should be the symmetry built in.

179
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,582
So what does this do for us?

180
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:45,540
I'm going to go ahead and cut a corner
and just copy this for a moment.

181
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,080
And I'm going to go
into TextEdit on my Mac.

182
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,900
And I'll slow down in just a moment.

183
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,790
But let me just show
you the revelation here.

184
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,160
Let me go ahead and save this.

185
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,830
And on my Mac, I'm going to
arbitrarily call it hello.HTML,

186
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,850
where dot HTML is just a convention
that humans use for web pages typically.

187
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,380
And I'm going to click Save.

188
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,450
Mac OS is going to be
minorly annoying and yell

189
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,366
at me because it wants me to save
it as a text file because it's text.

190
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:12,190
But no, I know better, it's HTML.

191
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,070
And now let me go to my actual
desktop, where I see this file here.

192
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,650
Today's slides, a screenshot,
and now hello.HTML.

193
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:26,050
And if I double-click on this,
I'm on the internet it would seem.

194
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,660
But not quite, well let's see.

195
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,940
Let me zoom in and what did I
mean by the head of the page?

196
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,400
Well, notice where the title
is, it's up there in the tab.

197
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,920
The body of the page happens
to be identically worded,

198
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,770
but that's the body of the page.

199
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,920
But I'm not really on the internet yet.

200
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,750
I have not made a website.

201
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,410
I've made a web page,
but it's not on the web.

202
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,270
Where is it?

203
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,270
It's on my desktop.

204
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,380
So if I told you all-- hey everyone, go
to File colon slash slash slash users

205
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,320
jharvard desktop, none
of you are going to be

206
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,870
able to see that because it's
only running on my computer.

207
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,860
Now I could run a web server
on my Mac or on your PC,

208
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,540
then we could via it's
private IP address,

209
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,874
share the files here internally.

210
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:09,956
But then, frankly, firewalls on my
computer or yours might get in the way.

211
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,300
So it's just generally annoying.

212
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,980
So ironically, going way
outside the bounds of Harvard

213
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,190
and using the cloud,
Cloud9 in this case,

214
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,550
or CS50 IDE, which is just
our customisation thereof,

215
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,210
allows us to actually do
everything publicly instead.

216
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,700
So let me go ahead and pause here.

217
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,533
And just as a proof of concept and
to get everyone on the same page,

218
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:31,650
go ahead and in Notepad or
in TextEdit on a PC or Mac,

219
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,740
respectively, go ahead and just
copy and paste that example

220
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,840
or whip it up yourself
or some variant thereof.

221
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,780
Save it and double-click it and
make sure it's working for you.

222
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,855
If you haven't already,
just do File, Save.

223
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:45,940


224
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:52,569
And save it there, too, as
hello.HTML or some such file name.

225
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,360
So even if you've never
used an IDE before,

226
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,540
you should find it fairly similar
to most any editing program.

227
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,150
And then there is one
step that we'll need

228
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,880
to do together to get this to work.

229
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,370
Stop me if going too fast, but
at this point in the story,

230
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,220
if you're following
along, you should have

231
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,710
hello.HTML in a tab, saved as such.

232
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,970
And on the top left, now,
you should see hello.HTML

233
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,110
having suddenly appeared
in your file browser.

234
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,760
So even though we are sort
of paradoxically on the web

235
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,220
right now and using a
web-based app, the web server

236
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,210
is not running-- our web server.

237
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,610
Cloud9's web server is running,
but not our personal web server.

238
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,730
So to make this work, in the little
terminal window, the blue window

239
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,580
down below, go ahead
and run a command, it's

240
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,060
a slightly custom
command called apache50.

241
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,530
Recall that Apache is the very popular
open-source software, for Linux

242
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,670
especially, that runs
many websites out there.

243
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,810
In fact, it's still, I think, the
most popular web server out there.

244
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,850
Run apache50, which is our
own customisation of it

245
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,480
so that it's easier to start.

246
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,630
And do apache50 space
start space period.

247
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,170
And what this command does is it
says, hey Apache, hey web server,

248
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,390
start yourself using
the current directory.

249
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,980
Dot means the current directory
as the root of the web server.

250
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,980
And that's important
because the hello.HTML

251
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,150
file we just created is in this folder.

252
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,290
And insofar as that's the file we
want to serve up to the internet,

253
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,042
we need to go ahead and start
the web server in this folder.

254
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:26,750
So if you hit Enter,
you should hopefully

255
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,910
see a successful message followed
by a URL, which you can hover over.

256
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,820
And then click and Open.

257
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,320
And you should see something
that looks like my screen here.

258
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,780


259
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,960
So these are the
contents of the directory

260
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,980
in which we started our web server.

261
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,900
And so now, if you click on hello.HTML,
you should see an error message.

262
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,470
So what's-- yes?

263
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,730
No?

264
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,680
You see your file?

265
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,180
OK.

266
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,490
Let me-- does anyone else see forbidden?

267
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,330
You see forbidden.

268
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:04,830
All right.

269
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,250
So let me do this.

270
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,423
Let me go back here.

271
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:14,050


272
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,350
Oh, I know what that-- OK.

273
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,480
That's curious that you didn't see
this, but let's go ahead and do this.

274
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,810
Go ahead and do-- in
your terminal window,

275
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:28,152
the blue window, chmod for
change mode plus or sorry--

276
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,920
a plus r for all plus read.

277
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,130
So let everyone read this
file, which is by design

278
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,270
since we want it to be on the internet.

279
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,140
And then hello.HTML.

280
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,034
So again, we're mixing
a graphical interface,

281
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:42,950
which is the tabs and the menu options
and the things with which we're

282
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,020
all familiar and comfortable with
a command-line interface, which

283
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,710
is purely text-based, which is older
school but more powerful and versatile

284
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,780
and still very much in vogue
for software development.

285
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,980
Nothing should happen
when you run that command

286
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,980
unless you see an error message,
in which case it's probably a typo.

287
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,710
But then if you go back to that
other window and click Reload now,

288
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,970
you should see it,
albeit somewhat small.

289
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,470
OK.

290
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,670
And what we've done, to be clear, is
we've given read permission to all,

291
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,100
to everyone in the world.

292
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,780
And that now allows our file to be
publicly accessible on the internet.

293
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,520
So incredibly underwhelming.

294
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,380
So let's now actually do
something that's a bit more

295
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,330
interesting in the following ways.

296
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,710
But before I forge ahead, I know we have
a few folks who just need to catch up.

297
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,260
But just call me over during
the next lull if you'd like.

298
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,080
Any questions?

299
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,780
So that we don't lose folks.

300
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,270
Yeah?

301
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,930
You are.

302
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,450
OK.

303
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,140
Where did this get you?

304
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

305
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,666
DAVID MALAN: OK.

306
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,210
So click Private.

307
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,730
And then CS50 Harvard University.

308
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,757
And then Create Workspace,
the green button down below.

309
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,840
And let me come back in a moment again,
this will take a moment to create.

310
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,570
All right.

311
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,301
So this is all very underwhelming, but
let's do a couple of different things

312
00:14:59,301 --> 00:14:59,800
here.

313
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,980
Let me go ahead and go into my
web page-- the editor, here.

314
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,610
And suppose I want to
do the following, let

315
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,400
me grab some sample Latin
text for just a moment.

316
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,710
I'll get myself five paragraphs--
just three paragraphs is fine.

317
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,290
So this is sort of nonsensical
text and I'm going to ahead

318
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,970
and paste it into my page like this.

319
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,660
And you can see it's not
wrapping because it's quite long.

320
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,580
Can I wrap that?

321
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,080
I won't worry about that for now.

322
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,580
OK.

323
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,720
So I have three long paragraphs.

324
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,280
And I'm going to go
ahead and reload my page.

325
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,400
And it looks like one bigger paragraph.

326
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,650
What is going on?

327
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,840
Well, it turns out HTML
is a markup language.

328
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,910
And it's only going to do
what you tell it to do.

329
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,400
And what I have not told it to do is
to give me line breaks or paragraph

330
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,120
breaks.

331
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,980
So if I actually want these
three things to be paragraphs,

332
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,940
it turns out in HTML there's a
Paragraph tag or p tag to be succinct.

333
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,850
And if I open the Paragraph
tag like this, here.

334
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,660
And I then close it, here.

335
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,960
And then I open it again, here.

336
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,834
Notice that the editor is actually
trying to be a little too helpful.

337
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,130
The moment it notices that I
have opened a tag so to speak,

338
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,550
it tries to be helpful
by closing it for me.

339
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:19,390
But of course, I need to now move
that to be actually below the text

340
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,400
so that I keep everything
nicely hierarchical as intended.

341
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,810
So now it's gotten more
verbose, but HTML kind of like,

342
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,590
if you remember many, many
years ago, Word Perfect,

343
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,217
before there was a way to make things
bold and italics and WYSIWYG editors,

344
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:36,050
What You See Is What You Get, you
would actually have to be emphatic

345
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,850
and say make this bold, make this
underline, make this italics.

346
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,220
So now that I've done
that, if I save and reload,

347
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,290
still pretty ugly but at
least now I have the semblance

348
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,290
of three actual paragraphs.

349
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,050
So let me go ahead and rewind for just
a moment, that's all fine and good.

350
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,310
What about something like a list
of my three favorite things?

351
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,280
So I'm going to give myself
an ordered list with ol.

352
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,860
So you can tell the
authors of HTML tried to be

353
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,490
very succinct if cryptic sometimes.

354
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,300
Then I want to list item and
I will say my favorite things

355
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:17,430
are-- I don't know, like movies,
and then li TV, and then how

356
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,680
about books, number three.

357
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,520
So if I save that, how
do you think this is

358
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,149
going to render, based on other things
you've seen on the internet already?

359
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:27,520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

360
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,950
DAVID MALAN: Yeah, numerical
list of things, let me reload.

361
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,710
And indeed I get this automatically.

362
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,280
Still pretty simple, but it's sort
of adding the logical structure

363
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,330
of numbering for me.

364
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,300
If I didn't like that
and I actually love

365
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,830
reading equally with
everything else, and reload,

366
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,372
now I get the familiar bulleted list.

367
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,955
And there's other ways to stylize
this that we'll come back to

368
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:46,860
in just a moment.

369
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,410
This, of course, is not really what
the web is great for-- static text,

370
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,120
but the whole point of the web
in HyperText Markup Language

371
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,350
was to have hypertext,
text that links elsewhere.

372
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:05,160
So why don't I greet the user with
my favorite website is say a href--

373
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,720
and what am I doing here?

374
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,080
So notice the following.

375
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,150
Actually, let me do this.

376
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,990
I got ahead of myself-- www.harvard.edu.

377
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,850
So all of us have been very
acclimated by websites-- to any time

378
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,070
you type a URL in certain websites,
they automatically become clickable.

379
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,590
And this is a feature of
modern browsers or really

380
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,740
of modern websites using language called
JavaScript, more on that tomorrow.

381
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,230
But this, of course, is not a link.

382
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,820
Like nothing is actually happening here.

383
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,760
I need to, again, tell the
browser to be emphatic.

384
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,580
So I want to say a for
anchor, which means link.

385
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,930
href, which means Hyper reference or
what is the URL I want to link to.

386
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,070
And now I want to go to harvard.edu.

387
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:54,000
Close quote, close bracket,
and now Harvard's website.

388
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,020
So notice here, there's some
fundamentally new syntax.

389
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,200
The open bracket a says give me a link,
href modifies the behavior of this tag.

390
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,897
So it turns out that whereas a
is a tag, href is an attribute.

391
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,230
And an attribute just modifies
the behavior of that tag.

392
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,660
And in this case, and
you would only know this

393
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,480
from having been told by someone
or by reading the documentation.

394
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,420
href controls the destination
of that hyperlink.

395
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,420
And then notice, here, that
I'm still closing the tag.

396
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,680
So what is this going to look like
visually on a web page once I reload?

397
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,230
What am I going to see, literally?

398
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:29,730
OK.

399
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,820
Yeah, Harvard's website.

400
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,710
My favorite website
is Harvard's website.

401
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,430
I'm not going to see the URL.

402
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,120
But it's going to work-- reload.

403
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,350
And now we get the old school but
familiar blue underlined hyperlink.

404
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,367
And if I scroll down--
if I hover over it,

405
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:45,200
it's really small,
especially on the screen.

406
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,260
What do you see in the bottom
left-hand corner of either screen?

407
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,940
The actual destination.

408
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,770
So this is kind of a juicy moment to
mention a potential security concern.

409
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,110
How many of you have
ever been phished before?

410
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,230
P-H-I-S-H-E-D, which means you've
received an email purporting to be from

411
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,090
usually like Paypal or eBay or
your bank or something like that,

412
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,587
that's actually just trying to phish
for your username and password.

413
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:12,170
Most everyone-- I mean it probably
ends up in your spam folder

414
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,610
these days, because the mail providers
have gotten pretty good about this.

415
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,050
But what feature of HTML do
these phishers take advantage of?

416
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,890
Well, they might actually
do something like this.

417
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:34,339
They could have this be-- let's
call it HTTP bad guy website phish--

418
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:37,630
I'm trying to pick a domain that doesn't
actually exist and creep everyone out.

419
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,100
So bad guy phishing website-- OK.

420
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,960
That probably doesn't exist,
but don't visit it just in case.

421
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,850
And if I reload, the text, of
course, still seems the same.

422
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,220
And if you hover over it, of course,
you see the malicious destination.

423
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,980
But more maliciously, as is the case in
a lot of these phishing attacks, what

424
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,060
if I do this?

425
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,590
And deliberately type it to be
dichotomous with the actual URL.

426
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,860
And if I reload now,
most of us are probably,

427
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,890
given a link like this,
going to click it.

428
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,725
I mean most of us are not so uptight
as to first hover over every link we're

429
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:17,560
about to visit look at what it is
in the bottom left-hand corner,

430
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,850
and then proceed to click.

431
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,490
So how do these phishing attacks work?

432
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,150
What are they trying to get you to do?

433
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,230
This is the how?

434
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,152
What's the why?

435
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:29,985
Go to their website.

436
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:32,990
But why is that useful?

437
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,939
So you log in.

438
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:35,980
And in fact, you know
what, let me try something.

439
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,290
Let me go to-- let's say a bank that's
in Harvard Square, BankofAmerica.com.

440
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,440
Here's their website.

441
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,970
Recall from earlier that you can go in
Chrome to View, Developer, View Source,

442
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,220
and I.E. and Firefox all have the same.

443
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,820
Here is their HTML,
it's a little cryptic,

444
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,760
it's longer certainly
than the pages we ran.

445
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,970
That's crazy long.

446
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:01,040
I'm just going to go ahead and
copy it and paste it into Cloud9,

447
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,220
it's all 1,390 lines of it.

448
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,880
Save that in hello.HTML.

449
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,070
And now reload the page.

450
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,140
And notice my URL, I'm
on Cloud c9users.io.

451
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,800
So this is not certainly
Bank of America's site.

452
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,370
Let me go ahead and reload.

453
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,770
Woo.

454
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,730
I have re implemented
Bank of America's website.

455
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,590
But fortunately, you know, actually I'm
stealing material from tomorrow now.

456
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,840
You know it's secure, because
look at that padlock icon there.

457
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,890
But what does that mean?

458
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,530


459
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,240
Notice my URL.

460
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,430
Actually, ironically, it is secure.

461
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:43,880
But my-- connection is secure, it's
a c9users.io, not Bank of America.

462
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,930
So what does this mean?

463
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,479


464
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:49,770
No, it just means someone
who works for Bank of America

465
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,810
knows how to make icons
that look like padlocks.

466
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,540
I mean, it literally is simple as that.

467
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,373
So there's this whole
can of worms, I'll try

468
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:59,520
to defer this till tomorrow
because it's kind of a rabbit

469
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,605
hole of interesting frightening topics.

470
00:23:01,605 --> 00:23:02,480
But it means nothing.

471
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,854
And a phishing attack, really
is someone, who spent what?

472
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:07,360
All of 30 seconds copying
someone else's website,

473
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,950
trying to trick you into going to it.

474
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,370
But the takeaway here isn't
so much that specific example,

475
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,280
but just how HTML works.

476
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,160
And how you can so quickly, after
like 5 minutes of the language,

477
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,380
start to abuse it in
a way that leverages

478
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,772
what we call social engineering.

479
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:22,480
These aren't technological
attacks really

480
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,880
as they are human social attacks.

481
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,520
All right, so let's do something else.

482
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,394
The internet, of course,
is filled with cats.

483
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:32,450
So if we Google for a cat,
let's just grab-- that's cute,

484
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,540
a little image like this.

485
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,810
And now, notice, this file, by nature
of being on the internet, has a URL.

486
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:42,980
And so let me go ahead and if this were
my own cats URL on my own web server

487
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,500
and I want to embed it, let
me go ahead and do this.

488
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,060
Instead of my favorite
website, my favorite cat

489
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:56,380
is image source equals
quote unquote that URL.

490
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,050
And then, here, I'm going
to do alt picture of a cat.

491
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,520
An underappreciated feature of
HTML that more website's should

492
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,850
be sensitive to is alternative text
for folks who are without sight

493
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,751
or rely on screen readers for
recitation of what a site is.

494
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,250
Of course, if someone's blind
and they can't see this image,

495
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,310
it would be nice, certainly, if the
computer could tell them what it is.

496
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,640
And so simply by providing
alternative text, a picture of a cat,

497
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,040
you can go part way toward actually
helping the user follow along

498
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,330
with what's on your page.

499
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,450
And if I now hit reload, here, my
favorite cat is this thing here.

500
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,720
And it turns out there are going to be
mechanisms that allow us to scale this

501
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,310
appropriately, although
we could just open it

502
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,101
in Photoshop or some other program
and actually integrate it better

503
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:38,820
into the website.

504
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,130
But the point is, it's these very
simple building blocks with which

505
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,150
the entirety of the web is made.

506
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,510
We can do other things
like if for whatever reason

507
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,320
I want to emphasize cat, we can style
that and other text differently.

508
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,520
And actually is there-- let's see.

509
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,250
Let's start to do exactly that.

510
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:02,110
Let me go ahead and grab
some Latin text again,

511
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:07,100
just so we have some
actual text to play with.

512
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,700
And grab two paragraphs of this again.

513
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,660
This is just a popular way of generating
sample text with which to play.

514
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,490
Let me go ahead and
paste it into the site,

515
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,960
give myself a couple of paragraphs.

516
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,110
Let me go ahead and fix this real fast.

517
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,330
Close the paragraph.

518
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:23,830
Whoops.

519
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,140
Close the paragraph.

520
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,960
Open the Paragraph.

521
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,700
Delete this.

522
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,200


523
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,242
OK.

524
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:33,450
So here's where we're at now.

525
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,880
We're back to just a couple
of simple paragraphs.

526
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,120
And let's suppose I want
to change the font of this.

527
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,870
As best I can tell, this is like Times
New Roman in 14 points or something

528
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,160
like that, whatever the
website's default is.

529
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,610
Well, turns out that
back in the day, you

530
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,310
would actually do something like color
equals red or something like that.

531
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:54,960
But the world eventually realized
that mixing your data with metadata,

532
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,700
specifically mixing your data
with the presentation thereof,

533
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,130
is generally bad practice.

534
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,712
Certainly these days, because it makes
it much harder to maintain your website

535
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:04,045
and in turn your data long-term.

536
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:06,800
It makes it much harder to change
the aesthetics of your website

537
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,750
over time, if you want to do
a refresh, change the colors,

538
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,020
change the iconography.

539
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,450
And so the world has gotten
a lot better at factoring out

540
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,280
anything related to aesthetics
to a separate language called not

541
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,680
HTML, but CSS, cascading style sheets.

542
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,950
And unfortunately, the syntax
for this is a little different.

543
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,200
But it still follows
some simple patterns.

544
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,510
If I go into the head of my web
page and introduce a style tag,

545
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,840
notice that I can do the following.

546
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,340
I can specify that you know what,
I want every paragraph in my page

547
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,200
to have the following properties.

548
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,090
And notice the new syntax, here,
where we have curly braces like this.

549
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,280
And I want to go ahead
and say, you know what,

550
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,480
make the font size-- oh, it's too big.

551
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,570
Let's make it 11 point.

552
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,990
And the color is just a little annoying.

553
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:00,480
Let's go ahead and make
it a nice shade of blue.

554
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,070
So CSS, if you've kind of seen the
entirety of its grammar so to speak,

555
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:08,550
although there are some few other
features, you have key-value pairs.

556
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,880
The key is a word like color or
font size, the value of those

557
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,910
respectively is blue or 11 point.

558
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,140
You would only know what
the valid keys and values

559
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,270
are by reading the
documentation or taking a class

560
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,640
or reading a book or whatnot.

561
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,640
But if I now reload
this, the effect is going

562
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,110
to be make all paragraph tags
content match these properties.

563
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,900
So if I go to Hello World and
click Reload, it's not very pretty

564
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,970
but the text is indeed a little
smaller and it's much bluer.

565
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,240
And so I've achieved that effect.

566
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:44,560
If instead I want to do something
different, suppose that font family,

567
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,776
I really don't like the
old school serif approach,

568
00:27:47,776 --> 00:27:50,400
here, I want it to look a little
more modern, a little fresher,

569
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,108
I can change the family
to be sans serif.

570
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:55,110
And if you notice, this
is the before, after,

571
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,530
and now we've changed the font entirely.

572
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,167
And we've just scratched the
surface, here, of what we can do.

573
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:02,750
But ultimately, the paradigm,
now, is that we have the ability

574
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,900
to separate the aesthetics of
our page, the stylistic decisions

575
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,060
from the content, but
there's still a problem.

576
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,700
So notice that we're still
inside the same file, hello.HTML.

577
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,590
And it turns out that even though yes,
there is this style tag right here--

578
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,940
it turns out that's not best practice.

579
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,170
Best practice would have
us put it not up here,

580
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,890
but instead use the tag as follows.

581
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,680
A link tag, which annoyingly
named is not a hyperlink,

582
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,960
it just links to another resource.

583
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,022
That resource, in this case, is a file
called styles.CSS, which I'll stipulate

584
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:39,480
is just a file containing a
whole bunch of key-value pairs,

585
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,540
a bunch of properties as we just saw.

586
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,664
And then the relationship, here, is
that it's a style sheet, which you just

587
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:46,390
have to copy and paste.

588
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,210
So I've removed from
the file, apparently,

589
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,030
per this yellow highlight,
all of the properties

590
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,560
and moved them into a separate file.

591
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,277
Why might it be good to do that?

592
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,110
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

593
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,987
DAVID MALAN: Or was that just a stretch?

594
00:28:58,987 --> 00:28:59,820
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

595
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:07,220


596
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:07,960
DAVID MALAN: OK.

597
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,959
Exactly, you can factor
out the different job's.

598
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:13,180
So one of you can focus
on the actual content

599
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,510
that you want to display, the images,
the text, the sort of business

600
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,170
or the products you're trying to sell.

601
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,280
And then someone else, who's
perhaps more artistic, and better

602
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,520
than you at that can
actually do the refinements.

603
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,490
What does the text look like?

604
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,281
Where is it placed?

605
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:26,800
Where to get all the aesthetics?

606
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,940
So that makes sense.

607
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,380
What else might be compelling about
factoring out CSS from the style tag

608
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,460
in the page to a
separate file like this?

609
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,627
Yeah, Vanessa.

610
00:29:36,627 --> 00:29:37,460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

611
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:45,347


612
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:47,180
DAVID MALAN: Exactly,
if you're-- right now,

613
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,590
we're assuming naively we have
just one page, hello.HTML.

614
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,290
If you have 2 pages,
10 pages, 1,000 pages--

615
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,340
how else are you going to make all
of the text blue or all of the text

616
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,840
sans serif?

617
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,270
You don't want to have to
copy and paste that same block

618
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,830
in every one of those files,
if only because, God forbid,

619
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,130
you want to change the aesthetics
of the site tomorrow or in a year,

620
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,840
now you have to go through and change
2 or 10 or 1,000 pages separately.

621
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,370
Much better to factor that out,
put it in one central place.

622
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,740
What about more technically?

623
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:19,660
If you were a browser, why might
you prefer, too-- or even a user,

624
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:23,211
why might you, too, prefer that the CSS
be factored out into the separate file

625
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:23,710
styles.CSS?

626
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,930


627
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,430
Vanessa?

628
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,680


629
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,370
Easier to read.

630
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,599
A little bit.

631
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,432
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

632
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:42,339


633
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:43,380
DAVID MALAN: That's fair.

634
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,310
So the browser definitely
won't care, because it's just

635
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,370
going to read it as text, top to
bottom, left to right, no matter

636
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,390
how messy it is.

637
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,970
And a user, yeah, that's nice.

638
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,990
But I don't really care
as the business owner

639
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:56,820
about making my source code so to
speak easier for humans to read.

640
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,890
After all, I don't want
them copying and pasting

641
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,490
it even easier like Bank of America.

642
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,010
Oh, OK.

643
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,220
Sure, then that's fair.

644
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,720
Factoring out into some
central, more readable place.

645
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,740
Why might a browser or an
end user actually benefit

646
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:14,295
from factoring out your
CSS into a file like this?

647
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:15,720
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

648
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,880
DAVID MALAN: Runs it one time or more
specifically downloads it one time.

649
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,907
If you have a user visiting this
page and that page and that page,

650
00:31:22,907 --> 00:31:24,990
and the content is, of
course, changing, after all

651
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,031
that's why they're visiting different
web pages, to see different things.

652
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:31,850
But the stylization is global in
the sense that all of those pages

653
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,870
are including this same file.

654
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,560
The upside of that is that
especially if it's a really big file,

655
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,370
the website browser only has to
download it once and do what with it?

656
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,370
It's a book.

657
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,020
Copy.

658
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,790
Or just to borrow the more technical
term from earlier, to actually cache it

659
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,801
for some amount of time.

660
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:51,550
Now, caching, we know
can work against you

661
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,410
because if then the browser
remembers it longer than you

662
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,170
intend it might actually backfire.

663
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,420
But at least if you're not
changing the CSS that often

664
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,920
or if the browser only caches
it for a few minutes or hours,

665
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,705
it can certainly help,
especially on devices like this.

666
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:05,580
What's frightening these days--
let's go ahead and do this real fast.

667
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:11,630
If I go to Chrome and go to
View Developer, but not Source,

668
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,510
but Developer Tools.

669
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,980
Most browsers these days have
fairly arcane features like this

670
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,820
built in, whereby if I
click on the Network tab,

671
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:25,660
I can actually see all of the HTTP
requests that Chrome is about to make.

672
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,970
So let me go somewhere-- whoops.

673
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,180
Let's see, let's go somewhere
like CNN by moving this up.

674
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,650
Come on, come on.

675
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,830
No, come on.

676
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,330
OK.

677
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,940
Let me move this all the way up.

678
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,220
Let me go to CNN.com, Enter.

679
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,690
And notice that just visiting
CNN's web page-- dear God.

680
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,580
OK, it's even worse than
the last time I did this.

681
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,456
How many HTTP requests did my browser
just make in order to visit CNN.com?

682
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:01,640


683
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,490
300-- atrociously 24 requests.

684
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,940
Each of which-- oh, now it's up to 325.

685
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,470
Each of which represents
apparently a JPEG or PNG,

686
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,630
which are image file formats, which is
not unreasonable for like a new site.

687
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,790
Some of these are script files,
JavaScript, which we discussed.

688
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,900
GIF, which is an image format.

689
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,150
GIF, GIF, GIF, GIF.

690
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,780
Script, Script, Script, Script.

691
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:30,990
I mean-- my God, this is
actually just remarkable.

692
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,490
Wow!

693
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,470
A lot of this frankly
is advertising, too.

694
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:35,970
Wow!

695
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,470
All right.

696
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,940
So, OK.

697
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,090
Why is this bad?

698
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:46,420
Never mind the content from CNN,
but why is this technologically bad?

699
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,105
Yeah.

700
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:48,260
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

701
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,759
DAVID MALAN: Consumer bandwidth,
and it's not just bandwidth

702
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:53,850
because at the end of the day-- well,
it's pretty big, it's 3.8 megabytes.

703
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,310
But it turns out downloading one
3.8 megabyte image would probably

704
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:03,240
reach me faster than 332,
now, files that individually

705
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,420
represent 3.8 megabytes.

706
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,650
So it's not so much the
bandwidth that's concerning,

707
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:14,514
but it's another measure of sort
of speed that users experience.

708
00:34:14,514 --> 00:34:16,389
And the words come up
a couple times already.

709
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,966


710
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:20,466
Late--

711
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:21,300
Latency.

712
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,330
OK, good.

713
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,580
OK, latency, which is different.

714
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,880
Bandwidth-- often latency,
especially if you've ever

715
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,310
used like YouTube or
Netflix or Hulu or the like,

716
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,080
latency is that delay from
when you visit a video

717
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,739
and it takes like a second or
five seconds to start playing.

718
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:41,810
But then it looks beautiful because you
have a good bandwidth but bad latency.

719
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,800
By contrast, if you had
good latency, the video

720
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,081
might start streaming instantly but
very suddenly get very pixelated

721
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,580
or hang or buffer and that's
because you have bad bandwidth.

722
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,100
So latency describes the
amount of time it takes.

723
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,179
And for the browser to be
doing this, what's happening?

724
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,990
Well, recall from my simple
example earlier of the cat,

725
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:03,700
that an HTML file can, inside of it,
reference other files or other URLs.

726
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,140
A browser is defined upon reading
a web page, to look inside of it,

727
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,750
looking for all of the images,
all of the movie files,

728
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,960
audio files, anything that's
mentioned inside of it,

729
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,030
it's designed to go fetch all of those
URLs as well one at a time or a few

730
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,990
at a time.

731
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:25,000
So the result is that CNN's web page,
index.HTML as it might be called,

732
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,890
itself mentions all of
these other darn files.

733
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:33,260
So we are inducing, by visiting
CNN.com, 335 separate HTTP

734
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,700
requests, some of which might
be parallelized to be fair,

735
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,130
but that's 300 requests.

736
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,830
Each of which might have
200 milliseconds of latency

737
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,560
and actually you can see how
long each one of these takes.

738
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,010
It's all between 0
milliseconds and 150 or 200.

739
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,860
And imagine doing the
same on your phone.

740
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,450
So phones have even less bandwidth
and it's often higher latency,

741
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,940
so this is not necessarily a great
user experience on the phone.

742
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,760
So how might websites
mitigate this concern?

743
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,680
Like I feel like having my
phone downloaded 335 files

744
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,670
is not very good for business
for making me want to come back.

745
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,840
They have a mobile version.

746
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,399
So you can detect with
high probability if a user

747
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,690
is coming from a mobile device.

748
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,650
How is that?

749
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,830
How would you know?

750
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:24,870


751
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,640
Oh.

752
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,371
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

753
00:36:27,371 --> 00:36:29,620
DAVID MALAN: Yeah, the browser
should tell the website

754
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,400
and indeed all browsers do.

755
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,920
In fact, if I scroll
back up in time and go

756
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,520
to the very first request for
www.CNN.com and I click on headers,

757
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,590
this is fairly arcane
information that would now

758
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,390
be found inside of those
virtual envelopes we

759
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,990
were discussing this morning.

760
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:51,140
And if I zoom in on
this, notice here, these

761
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:56,310
are exactly the headers so to speak,
the text that my browser put inside

762
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,750
of that virtual envelope.

763
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,890
Odds are the first two lines look
familiar based on my quick example

764
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,040
earlier, when I manually typed it in.

765
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,350
But what is minorly
revealing about yourself?

766
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:13,600


767
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,830
What's the takeaway here,
in terms of privacy perhaps?

768
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,027
Or curiosity?

769
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,770


770
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,630
What else is my browser
presumptuously telling CNN?

771
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:31,100
Yeah, it's telling CNN that I own a Mac
running version Mac OS 10.11.2 no less,

772
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,610
which is oddly precise.

773
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,620
What browser-- actually this
is historically confusing.

774
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,300
But what browser am I apparently using?

775
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,230
Chrome.

776
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,829
So that's mildly
interesting information,

777
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:45,870
especially since it turns out web
development is still kind of a headache

778
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,630
even all these years later after
it's inception since so many

779
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,040
of the manufacturers Google
and Microsoft and Mozilla all

780
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,242
can't re agree on all of
the implementation details.

781
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:56,450
So one of the frustrations
in fact of web development

782
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,720
is you might design something on
Chrome, looks amazing on your Mac,

783
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,420
looks awful or broken or somehow other
on a PC or on Firefox or on safari

784
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,280
or on IE or Edge or any--
I mean it's the biggest

785
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,700
nightmare that libraries, more on
those tomorrow, are helping with.

786
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,590
Because you have other people
figure out all these headaches

787
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,390
and you build on top of their software.

788
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,780
So that's mildly disconcerting.

789
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,347
I also told CNN, already,
my IP address, because that

790
00:38:20,347 --> 00:38:22,680
had to be on the envelope for
the response to come back.

791
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,420
So there's a decent amount of
information being leaked here

792
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,210
that CNN is inferring.

793
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,670
But they can at least use that
as a feature to realize oh,

794
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,710
by way of a different user agent,
that's what this header is called,

795
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,590
they can infer if I'm on a mobile
device or an Android device

796
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,360
or an iPhone device, which can either
be used for statistical purposes

797
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,790
or to actually decide
what kind of data to send

798
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,140
or to request once you
visit that first web page.

799
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,640
All right.

800
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:54,800
So with that said, what does
this allow us to do ultimately

801
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,430
when we have tags like this?

802
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:00,060
So ultimately, we're going to be able
to do things a little more efficiently

803
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,920
by factoring out.

804
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,830
This would be an example of
best practices so to speak.

805
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,020
But we've really only just
scratched the surface of HTML.

806
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,420
But I think it's the kind
of language, frankly,

807
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,960
where if that's the extent
of our formal instruction,

808
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,124
here is our-- here's a tag,
here's what an attribute is,

809
00:39:16,124 --> 00:39:17,790
and here's how to find more information.

810
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:20,840
What I thought I'd propose, so that we
can get everyone back on the same page,

811
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,215
give you an opportunity to
get your hands a little dirty,

812
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:24,940
is propose a few different problems.

813
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,490
Almost all of which can be
solved with Google or Bing

814
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,110
or your favorite search engine.

815
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:33,350
Or by me whispering in your ear
or offering a little bit of tips.

816
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,150
So I wanted to propose, I'll turn
on some music, I'll wander about.

817
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,450
And let me propose that you tackle
one or two of these problems,

818
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:45,810
trying to bring to bear the very basic
conceptual ingredients we provided

819
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,600
but also Google.

820
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,100
So literally, it is totally
acceptable to type in web page

821
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:55,180
how make text bigger or CSS change
color of text or the like totally fine.

822
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,580
And indeed, you'll find that
this is how many developers

823
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,614
early on are self-taught.

824
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:01,530
Once they understand the
conceptual framework,

825
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:05,250
it's so much easier to bootstrap
yourself to understanding and applying

826
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,140
yet new techniques.

827
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,210
So I'll turn on some music,
tackle one or two of these,

828
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,010
I'll wander around
fielding some questions.

829
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,142
Yeah, Griff.

830
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:15,010
STUDENT: When you're creating
a separate style sheet,

831
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,878
are you just creating a new
tab at the top of the file?

832
00:40:17,878 --> 00:40:19,010
DAVID MALAN: Ah, yes.

833
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:19,510
Correct.

834
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,420
I did omit that part.

835
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,500
But yes, you would simply in the
IDE, create a new tab and new file.

836
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,960
And essentially repeat the steps from
before but call this something.CSS,

837
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,170
styles.CSS.

838
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,230
And do remember that
chmod command again.

839
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,180
This time for this
filename, where again,

840
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:44,479
you're changing the mode of the file to
give all read permission of styles.CSS

841
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:45,020
for instance.

842
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,311
You only have to run that once.

843
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:49,160
Because by default for security
sake, when you create files,

844
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,280
they are typically viewable only by you.

845
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,260
All right, feel free
to continue tinkering.

846
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:01,220
But I thought I'd try to tie everything
together for our final segment here.

847
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,640
This is, of course, Google.

848
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,660
And let me go ahead and see.

849
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,900
Google is constantly changing some of
this stuff-- even more from Google.

850
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,320
Is this going to work?

851
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,010
OK.

852
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,080
Let me go ahead and do
the following in Google.

853
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,180
I'm going to go ahead and
search for cats again.

854
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,970
Come on, search for cat.

855
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,980
Oh.

856
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,630
Oh, here we go.

857
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:28,080
Google.com and cats.

858
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,240
Enter.

859
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,770
And now notice what happens
when I search for cats.

860
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,550
So the URL changes from
just www.google.com to slash

861
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,270
search questionmark num equals 20
site equals something source equals

862
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:43,700
something-- oh, q equals cats.

863
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,630
And in fact, let me go ahead and just
delete all of the visual clutter here.

864
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,070
And whittle this URL down to just
this canonical form, if you will.

865
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,670
And hit Enter, and there's
apparently no difference.

866
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,450
Which is to say, it seems that we can
distill Google's functionality down

867
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,520
to its essence in terms
of its URL and kind of tie

868
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,670
this morning's conversation together
with this afternoon's and now

869
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,350
our HTML focus to figure
out how this exactly works.

870
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,860
So let's go ahead and use
this tool that developers

871
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,300
would super often use these days.

872
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,810
Going to Developer Tools,
down here going for instance,

873
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,370
to the Network tab as I did before.

874
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,737
I'm going to click Preserve Log.

875
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:24,820
And I'm going to go ahead
and hit Reload because I

876
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:29,330
want to see exactly what happens when
I visit or search for cats on Google.

877
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:32,230
So a little more modestly
that results in 57

878
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,680
HTTP requests, which at least
is decently fewer than earlier.

879
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,700
But let me look at the headers here.

880
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:46,710
Rather, let me look at this top part.

881
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,770
So this is the URL that I just requested
and the request method is something

882
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,190
we didn't really talk about explicitly
before, but I used this keyword get.

883
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,810
So get being the operative verb
when I made that verbal request

884
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,730
earlier for something of Google.

885
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,812
Status code is 200 and this
is a code you don't often see.

886
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:06,520
But it turns out, when
you visit websites

887
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,905
there is a number that you perhaps
annoyingly occasionally see.

888
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:14,240
Yeah, 404, perhaps the biggest.

889
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,900
404 is what?

890
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,530
Error more specifically, file not found.

891
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,270
And indeed, there's
this whole laundry list,

892
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:31,560
HTTP status codes that the official
list is-- not on Wikipedia-- is here.

893
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:37,020
And let me scroll down, it turns
out that you rarely hear about 200

894
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,740
because it means everything is OK.

895
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,621
But, indeed, when you visit a web
page by default, if all is well,

896
00:43:41,621 --> 00:43:44,120
you're getting back in the
virtual envelope from the server,

897
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,890
as, say, Sean did for me with
the cat, a 200 message saying OK,

898
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:50,760
here is the satisfaction
of your request.

899
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,390
Less common would be to 201, 202.

900
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,550
But if I scroll down here
to the 400s, 400s are bad.

901
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:03,640
Literally, bad request, if the browser
or client has malformed its request.

902
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,980
Unauthorized would mean there's some
kind of authentication required.

903
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,540
402, you don't really
see payment required.

904
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,610
Apparently future use has
been ongoing for some time.

905
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:17,430
Forbidden means, like some of you saw,
like me, you had to chmod your files

906
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,010
to make them world viewable.

907
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,420
And then here's the
famous 404 not found.

908
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,800
So just years ago,
people decided somewhat

909
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,030
arbitrarily that 404
shall henceforth mean

910
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,680
the file is not found on the server.

911
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,700
And thus was born millions of
mistakes that we all see later.

912
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,880
Worse is-- well this
one's kind of funny, gone.

913
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,120
Like the page you're
looking for is gone,

914
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,130
although you won't typically see that.

915
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,560
500, internal server
error, you might see

916
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,280
if you're developing
a web-based business

917
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,359
and you or your engineering
team is prone to mistakes.

918
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:48,650
Sometimes this means there's
a particularly bad problem

919
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,590
with the code on the backend,
with load balancers these days.

920
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,080
Not uncommon is to occasionally
see 503 service unavailable,

921
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,990
which typically means the load
balancer is responding to you

922
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,210
but no back servers
are actually available,

923
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,170
they're overloaded or offline
or broken for some reason.

924
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:06,900
And then another juicy one, that's worth
noting now because it ties together

925
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,880
our chat earlier, is moved permanently.

926
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,610
This web page has moved permanently.

927
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,470
Or found, the implication
of which is that it actually

928
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,250
wants you to go elsewhere.

929
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,390
So let me do this.

930
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:22,610
Let me go to this little
text-based program, Telnet,

931
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:26,460
and let me try going
to Google.com port 80.

932
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,010
Let me get their home
page using version 1.1

933
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,670
of HTTP, which I'm pretending to speak.

934
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,640
And the host shall be Google.com.

935
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,100
Enter.

936
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,830
Notice what actually comes back if I
visit not www.Google.com, which I did

937
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,206
do earlier but just Google.com.

938
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:50,120
A very, very small web page that
literally says the document has moved.

939
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,350
And most humans don't even see that
because their browsers understand

940
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,980
HTTP, specifically status codes.

941
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,260
And what's the status code
apparently that came back here?

942
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,920
It's 301, moved permanently.

943
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,800
What does that mean?

944
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,060
Well, if you look a little lower,
it includes a location header,

945
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,430
which we've not seen before even
though we've been experiencing it

946
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,030
with some of today's demos.

947
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:15,040
Google wants me to go
to which URL instead?

948
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,290
Yeah, so they apparently
want me to go to www instead.

949
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,080
So let me try that.

950
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,100
Let me instead go to--
sorry, let me do this again.

951
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:37,370
To www Enter, get slash HTTP
1.1 host www.Google.com Enter.

952
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,700
And now it actually comes back.

953
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,640
So Google wants me to
go to www.Google.com.

954
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,720
But both work apparently, it's
not like the site is unresponsive

955
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,240
like Harvard's was years
ago as I mentioned.

956
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,512
So why does Google want me to
standardize on www.Google.com?

957
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:55,958
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

958
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:58,250
DAVID MALAN: Yeah, force me
to go to one central place

959
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,615
so that they don't have
to maintain two websites.

960
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:00,577
Sure, why else?

961
00:47:00,577 --> 00:47:04,490


962
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:11,350
Why did I tell you to go to
CS50.io as opposed to www.CS50.io?

963
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:18,980
Or why do you go to bit.ly instead
of www.bit.ly for URL shortening?

964
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,640
It's a popular URL shortening service.

965
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,430
Easier and more to the point there.

966
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,477
Shorter, not to have to type it.

967
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:29,560
And so indeed, it's just this human
convention that we have long had these

968
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,590
subdomain's so to speak of, www---
or not even subdomains, host names,

969
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:38,520
www.something.com, it was all the more
of a visual cue that the user should be

970
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,200
going there.

971
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,550
It's a web page, but it's
slightly more verbose.

972
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,290
And also for technical
reasons, turns out

973
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,870
there's these things called
cookies-- more on those tomorrow.

974
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:50,169
And cookies are actually scoped
to the domain name in question.

975
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:52,210
So it turns out, especially
for bigger companies,

976
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,626
if you want to have multiple
web applications, all of them

977
00:47:54,626 --> 00:47:58,660
in something.com, you can give
them each their own cookies based

978
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,550
on what that initial host name is.

979
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,710
So you want to force your user
to go to some host name, not just

980
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:06,460
your root domain name
so that you actually

981
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,220
have a bit more control over
what they're actually receiving.

982
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,560
But we started this conversation
by looking at Google,

983
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,650
here, whose queries ended
up looking like this.

984
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:19,530
So it turns out, you know what, I
bet we could re implement Google.

985
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:23,200
And we don't even have to do it with
Cloud9, but I'll do it over here.

986
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,700
You could do this on
your desktop as well.

987
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:33,810
Let me go ahead and whittle this down
to be called my version of Google.

988
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,640
And then down here, let me get
rid of the fake Latin text.

989
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,800
And then here, let me introduce
a new technique, a form tag,

990
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,490
the action of which-- we'll
come back to that actually.

991
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:51,790
Form tag that has an input
whose type shall equal text.

992
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:55,506
And whose name is
going to be oh, say, q.

993
00:48:55,506 --> 00:48:59,760
And then another input,
whose type is submit, whose

994
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,480
value is use my version of Google.

995
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,320
Close quote, close tag, Save.

996
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,140
Excuse me, it's not complete yet.

997
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,770
But let me reload this page.

998
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:14,400
Interesting.

999
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,590
It's not all that sexy, either.

1000
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,000
So let me add a logo here.

1001
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,530
My version of Google, which
notice is using an H1 tag,

1002
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,520
heading one, which just
means big and bold.

1003
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,370
Reload.

1004
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:26,870
OK.

1005
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:28,078
It's getting a little better.

1006
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:32,980
And frankly, Google 1999,
it's not all that far off

1007
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,492
now from what Google was if you
want to relive the 1990s there.

1008
00:49:37,492 --> 00:49:39,200
All right, we need a
little bit of color,

1009
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,370
but it's not all that dissimilar to
what it is now ironically or remarkably.

1010
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,550
So let's just keep it here, we
won't worry about aesthetics.

1011
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,681
I want to go ahead and search for cats.

1012
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:50,180
Whoops!

1013
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,870
Not cats, but cats.

1014
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:53,590
Huh.

1015
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:59,200
It doesn't work, but notice here, it
did automatically append a question mark

1016
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,474
and a q equals cats as soon as I search.

1017
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:04,390
But I don't want the user to go to
my page because I have no database,

1018
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,810
I have no search results.

1019
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:06,750
What could I do?

1020
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:13,120
It turns out that I could go in here
and add an action whose value is https

1021
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,130
www.Google.com/search
and just to be clear,

1022
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:22,070
I'm going to use a method of Get
as opposed to something else,

1023
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,020
which we'll come back to called Post.

1024
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,180
Get, now, if I save
this, reload my page.

1025
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:35,080
And type cats, notice the URL
from which I go and to which I go.

1026
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,020
I seem to have re-implemented Google.

1027
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,840
I'm sort of-- I've implemented
the front-end so to speak,

1028
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,230
Google has implemented
a much harder backend.

1029
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:46,260
But notice, it even works for dogs.

1030
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,200
And notice it's pre-populating
this field up here.

1031
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,640
So what's actually going on?

1032
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,310
Well, if we actually look
at this HTTP request,

1033
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:56,100
let me go to search for cats again.

1034
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,340
But let me go ahead and open
up that same developer toolbar

1035
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,800
that I showed earlier.

1036
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,500
And preserve the logs so we can
see everything that happens.

1037
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,600
And now I'm going to click
Use my version of Google.

1038
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,340
Let's see what actually goes through.

1039
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:13,880
Here, in Google's case, notice that
I'm requesting this URL, q equals cats.

1040
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,000
Method is get 200, but where
did that request come from?

1041
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,210
Whereas before it came
from Google's own server.

1042
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,090
Well, their server was
just a web page that I

1043
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,820
happened to visit at www.Google.com,
so I filled it out and submitted it.

1044
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,432
But there's nothing stopping me from
filling out or creating my own web

1045
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:32,780
form whose action, so to speak,
goes elsewhere for fulfillment.

1046
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,390
That's not typically the
common case but it does rather

1047
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:39,610
tie all of these various
ingredients together.

1048
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:43,330
So what does this mean
now for the alternatives?

1049
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:47,060
There's Get and then lastly,
there's this thing called Post.

1050
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:51,620
When might you not want to use Get,
and why, based only on the example

1051
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,500
we've seen here.

1052
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:58,176


1053
00:51:58,176 --> 00:51:59,754
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1054
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:00,420
DAVID MALAN: OK.

1055
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,690
So if you just want one
result, you might not use Get.

1056
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,010
You could still use Get for that.

1057
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:10,710
And in fact, actually we can--
let's see, if we can distill this.

1058
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:16,830
If we go to google.com, you've reminded
me of the I'm feeling lucky button.

1059
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:20,020
If you do search, click
on I'm feeling lucky.

1060
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,670
Let me inspect this so we can sniff
our own network traffic so to speak.

1061
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,470
Click I'm feeling lucky.

1062
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:26,970
Let's see what's slightly different.

1063
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,820
We went to the top hit, which
apparently is Wikipedia.

1064
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:33,040
And notice the one thing
that's different here

1065
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:41,250
besides all of this nonsense
is site source-- is it this?

1066
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,870
No.

1067
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:45,622
What is the I'm feeling lucky icon?

1068
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:46,930
Ah.

1069
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,850
Let's see if we can
figure this out real fast.

1070
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,760
Button L. OK, I think it might be this.

1071
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,310
Let me secretly make a one
quick change-- or not so

1072
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,170
secretly, while everyone watches.

1073
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:04,900
Input, type equals
hidden, value equals 1.

1074
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,950
And then the name of that
field shall equal this.

1075
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,950
So I'm guessing this could backfire.

1076
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:15,450
I'm guessing that the means by
which Google has implemented

1077
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,890
their I'm feeling
lucky button is so long

1078
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:23,760
as the web form submits a name of
button i or button 1 with a value of 1.

1079
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,050
My hunch is that's going to take us
immediately to the first search result.

1080
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:27,800
So let's try that.

1081
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,010
Let me go back to my version of this.

1082
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:37,934
Click Reload, to refresh the form
and search this time for giraffes.

1083
00:53:37,934 --> 00:53:39,100
Whoops, that's not giraffes.

1084
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,310
Giraffes, just to prove
that this is different.

1085
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,506
Enter.

1086
00:53:43,506 --> 00:53:46,649
Yeah, this is the top hit
for giraffes on google.com.

1087
00:53:46,649 --> 00:53:47,940
So what am I playing with here?

1088
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,315
I'm playing with HTTP parameters.

1089
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,440
And indeed, this is what
ultimately drives the web.

1090
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,540
There's all the silly
aesthetics of HTML,

1091
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:58,720
of hyperlinks and images and bold
facing and blue text and sans

1092
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,940
serif and the like.

1093
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,090
But none of that is functional per
se, it's all aesthetic, a markup.

1094
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:06,460
With HTTP though, the protocol that
web browsers and server's speak,

1095
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,830
we have the ability to pass input from
browser, and in turn human, to server.

1096
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,530
And the simplest of
schemes is used to do that.

1097
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,590
Literally, what a browser
does to send input

1098
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:23,570
is to send a value like-- a name
like q with a value like cat.

1099
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:27,070
And if there is a second
argument or input to provide,

1100
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:31,120
there is literally an ampersand
and then you say and-- what was it?

1101
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,710
btnI equals 1.

1102
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,810
And then another ampersand if you have a
third key-value pair or HTTP parameter,

1103
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:42,250
and that is how the entire
web works with web forms.

1104
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,360
If you are using Facebook Messenger
and you fill out the little box

1105
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,720
to send a message and hit
Enter, what are you doing?

1106
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,690
You are sending the
equivalent of a message

1107
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,440
like this, that probably
has not cats for q,

1108
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,970
but whatever message you typed in.

1109
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,980
And it's probably not
called q for query,

1110
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,940
it's probably called m
for message or whatever

1111
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,460
Facebook has decided to call it.

1112
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,210
But these very simple
basic paradigms are

1113
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:06,640
the entirety of what drive the
web and these basic interactions.

1114
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,970
But sometimes you might not
want to see this in the URL.

1115
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:16,720
So to come back to the earlier question,
when might you not want to use Get,

1116
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,400
whereby Get means that this kind
of stuff ends up in the URL?

1117
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,950
Indeed, I keep showing in the
browser, precisely the results

1118
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,210
of clicking Submit.

1119
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:30,750
When would you not want your query or
your human input to appear in the URL,

1120
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:31,950
would you say?

1121
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,610
Yeah.

1122
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:34,530
Typing in a password.

1123
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,690
Don't want it to be
there, why, to be clear?

1124
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,523
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1125
00:55:37,523 --> 00:55:39,394


1126
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:42,310
DAVID MALAN: But I mean suppose it
was just you in from your computer.

1127
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,522
Let me push back harder, still bad, why?

1128
00:55:44,522 --> 00:55:47,604


1129
00:55:47,604 --> 00:55:49,000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

1130
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,750
DAVID MALAN: Yeah,
very reasonable, right?

1131
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:54,070
Especially since these days there's
always this notion of auto complete

1132
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,760
or a history in your browser.

1133
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,690
And when it gets stored
in the URL it's being

1134
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,240
saved for your later
convenience presumably

1135
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,770
or for your sibling or significant
other or parents or kids or whoever,

1136
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:05,856
prying eyes as well.

1137
00:56:05,856 --> 00:56:07,230
So you might not want to do that.

1138
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,188
What else besides passwords
might be sensitive?

1139
00:56:09,188 --> 00:56:13,800


1140
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,750
Usernames.

1141
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,540
Usernames.

1142
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,748
Yeah, a little less sensitive
but maybe not something

1143
00:56:17,748 --> 00:56:21,070
you want to reveal for your accounts.

1144
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:24,330
Credit card information, I mean
anything that mildly personal,

1145
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,090
you probably don't want it
appearing in the URL insofar

1146
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:32,150
as it ends up in the browser's cache and
history and autocomplete and so forth.

1147
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:36,086
In fact, why do some people use--
well, let's be more technical.

1148
00:56:36,086 --> 00:56:40,010
Technically, why do people use
incognito mode or private mode browsing?

1149
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:43,100
Well, what does it not do?

1150
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,050
No caches.

1151
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,950
Yeah, no caching, no cookies
and more on cookies tomorrow.

1152
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:50,910
So by using incognito mode or private
mode in your browser, among the things

1153
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:54,010
it does is it doesn't save the
autocomplete and the history.

1154
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,592
So if you did have the misfortune
of going to a website that foolishly

1155
00:56:57,592 --> 00:57:00,050
is putting your credit card
and email address and user name

1156
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:04,970
and such in the URL such that it
gets saved, at least in cognito mode,

1157
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:07,684
when you close it, throws
that information away.

1158
00:57:07,684 --> 00:57:10,850
Now in practice, most people use it not
for that defense because this is not

1159
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:12,558
a common problem, but
really because they

1160
00:57:12,558 --> 00:57:15,420
don't want websites they're visiting
and other such things to end up

1161
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,340
at all in their history as well.

1162
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,640
But the same would go true for
credit card numbers or the like.

1163
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,890
So I can think of at least a
few other things like YouTube,

1164
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,080
like you upload videos to YouTube.

1165
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,480
How in the world do you
put a video in the URL?

1166
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,850
Or how do you put a picture in a URL?

1167
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:37,500
All right, so there is kind
of some non-obvious problems

1168
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,135
to with non-obvious solutions
that arise if we're using Get

1169
00:57:40,135 --> 00:57:41,940
and in turn the URL alone.

1170
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,260
And so that too might kind of bite us.

1171
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,550
And indeed, there's no official
limit on the length of URLs.

1172
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:52,090
But there is sort of realistic limit
of like 1,000 characters, 2,000

1173
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:55,300
characters, unfortunately it
totally differs by browser.

1174
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,080
So thankfully, there exists
an alternative to Get

1175
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,680
called not Get but
Post that functionally

1176
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,570
does the same kind of thing, it
still has key-values and pairs

1177
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:07,040
and equal signs and ampersands.

1178
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,630
But it doesn't put it in the
URL, it instead so to speak

1179
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,670
puts it deeper into
the virtual envelope.

1180
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,900
So it's still there, but it's not
exposed to the browser in this way.

1181
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,590
And it lets us upload gigabyte
video files, megabyte image files,

1182
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,860
not to mention our email
addresses and passwords

1183
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,810
and credit card numbers and the like.

1184
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:28,750
And to enable that you simply
do this, change it to Post.

1185
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,170
Unfortunately the server
has to support it.

1186
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:36,620
So if I now search for
cats, again, using Post,

1187
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:39,000
unfortunately Google
just doesn't cooperate

1188
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,530
because for whatever technical or policy
reason they don't want to support Post.

1189
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:45,740
And it's probably just because it's an
unnecessary feature on their servers.

1190
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:47,760
And in the case of search
results, they probably

1191
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,390
want people linking to them
for advertising reasons,

1192
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,850
for deep linking reasons.

1193
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:55,320
So in fact, one of the most
compelling reasons to use Get

1194
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,040
is when you do want stuff
to end up in the URL.

1195
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,580
If I highlight this URL
and paste it into an email,

1196
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,807
I want you to see the
exact same search results.

1197
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,640
And there's nothing
more annoying-- and this

1198
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,920
is common to big business, who
have pretty shoddy websites, where

1199
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,540
there's no state maintained in the URL.

1200
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:15,450
So if you're shopping on some website
trying to buy something and the state,

1201
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:17,810
the unique product
identifier is not in the URL

1202
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:21,190
simply because the website has been
using Post or some other mechanism,

1203
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:24,700
there's no way to deep link to
that page that you're seeing.

1204
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,700
And so the effect of this
is you copy something,

1205
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,600
you paste it into an email or instant
message, someone clicks on it,

1206
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,183
I just see the home page or I'm
not seeing what you're seeing.

1207
00:59:32,183 --> 00:59:34,440
And this is all too common
with big e-commerce sites,

1208
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,250
not Amazon, but sort of less
trendy ones that haven't really

1209
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:41,620
given this much thought or care.

1210
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,430
Woo!

1211
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:44,800
That was a lot.

1212
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,415
Any questions?

1213
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,931


1214
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:48,430
No?

1215
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:48,930
All right.

1216
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,620
So where are we going with all of this?

1217
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:55,480
So today was meant to start--
well, we started pretty low so

1218
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,230
to speak with binary and we
sort of built our way back up.

1219
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:00,630
And then we reset ourselves
looking at how the web works

1220
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:03,500
and incarnation of all
of these ideas that

1221
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,620
have been-- on top of which
we've built to get to this point.

1222
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,780
Where do we go tomorrow?

1223
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,750
So in the morning, we'll take a look
at the general notion of privacy,

1224
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,810
security, and as it relates to society.

1225
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,480
Drawing upon a couple of
current events from a few months

1226
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,210
ago like the FBI issues with
Apple and how that played out

1227
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:23,180
and what the underlying questions
were, the general idea of encryption

1228
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,540
and how that works and what it's
good for and what risks it still

1229
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,350
presents to you.

1230
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:31,950
A case study like something like Dropbox
or SkyDrive or one drive or any number

1231
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:35,230
of incarnations of web-based
storage for consumers.

1232
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:38,140
Looking then a little
bit about programming.

1233
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:42,200
Talking about some of the basic building
blocks, some of the most common data

1234
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,235
structures and algorithms
that people use

1235
01:00:44,235 --> 01:00:47,360
that you might typically learn in an
instructor or computer science course.

1236
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,776
And the kinds of ingredients
you bring in a design meeting

1237
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:52,810
when you're trying to design some
piece of software thinking through,

1238
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,240
say on a white board, how is
it we're going to build this

1239
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,323
or how are we going to
build this efficiently, how

1240
01:00:57,323 --> 01:00:59,780
are we going to do our analytics
in a more efficient way

1241
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,690
than just throwing it all in a database
and just searching in an obvious way,

1242
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:06,160
actually engineering
non-obvious solutions.

1243
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,190
Technology stacks, which is just kind
of a generic way of describing types

1244
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,270
of software and work flows and
design patterns so to speak,

1245
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:18,170
with which you can build something
sort of a general methodologies.

1246
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:19,960
And then finally, web
programming, looking

1247
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,280
not at HTML and CSS and the
aesthetics of today's focus,

1248
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,670
but rather on some of
the technologies that

1249
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,851
underlie the most dynamic of websites.

1250
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,350
For instance, when you click
and drag on Google Maps and you

1251
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,500
suddenly see an infinite
number of squares

1252
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,750
from around the world, tiles
that represent that map--

1253
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,090
how is something like that working?

1254
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:41,339
When you're using Facebook Messenger and
all of a sudden a new message pops up

1255
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:44,967
without the whole web page reloading or
without you needing to reload the page,

1256
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,050
how does all of that work?

1257
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:47,966
It's ultimately driven
by this language called

1258
01:01:47,966 --> 01:01:52,150
JavaScript, which has no relationship
to Java, another programming language

1259
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:52,920
altogether.

1260
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,400
But as part of our technology
stacks discussion tomorrow,

1261
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:59,730
we'll start sort of a laundry list of
yet more words of jargon and product

1262
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:03,490
names and the like just so that
you're not necessarily comfy with all

1263
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:06,890
of those topics, but at least have seen
them and can kind of roughly mentally

1264
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,020
categorize them all.

1265
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:12,870
So as to look more effectively
up that additional information.

1266
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:14,950
Any questions?

1267
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:15,450
All right.

1268
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,196
Well, why don't we officially wrap here.

1269
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:19,570
I'll turn on some music, I'll
spend some one-on-one time.

1270
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,090
If you have any questions
you want me to rewind

1271
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:23,090
with any of today's topics
or hands on material,

1272
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:25,637
I believe there are some
snacks and drinks outside.

1273
01:02:25,637 --> 01:02:28,720
There's a reception officially til 6,
I'll stick around for any questions.

1274
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,000
But otherwise we'll
see you in the morning

1275
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,530
and I'll send around an e-mail tonight
with maybe some URLs from today

1276
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:34,155
that you might want to look at to play.

1277
01:02:34,155 --> 01:02:35,900
So enjoy.

1278
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,589
