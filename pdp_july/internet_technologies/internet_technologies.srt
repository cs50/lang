1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,207


2
00:00:00,207 --> 00:00:03,040
DAVID J. MALAN: But why don't we
begin now with internet technology.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,420
The goal of the session
being to better understand

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,730
how this thing works that most of us
use every day, how we can leverage it,

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,910
and most importantly, try to build
it conceptually from the ground up.

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,160
So that after today
and after tomorrow, you

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,617
have not only the practical benefit
of being able to diagnose things

8
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:23,450
in the real world a
little more effectively,

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,500
you've sort of had the
opportunity to think through,

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,680
with the proverbial engineering hat,
how you could go about building things.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,969
That at first glance might
seem so terribly complex,

12
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:33,260
but at the end of the day
are the result of some fairly

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,320
logical well-defined decisions,
again layering from bottom to top.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,610
So with that said, what is the internet?

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,511
Let's start there.

16
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:46,860


17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,000
Half of you are on it right now, so
you must know what is the internet?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,930
What is the internet?

19
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,555
Yes.

20
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,055
Sean.

21
00:00:55,055 --> 00:01:00,419
AUDIENCE: It's a way to access different
websites, I guess, [INAUDIBLE].

22
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:01,210
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,989
So a way to access different
websites, network structure.

24
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:04,489
OK.

25
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,330
Let's dive in a little more physically.

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,880
So that's what it does.

27
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,593
What is it actually?

28
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:13,380


29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,295
What do you got, [? Abi ?]?

30
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:16,170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

31
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,320
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

32
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:17,820
Good.

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,400
More precise.

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,800
So a network of devices.

35
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,230
And a network is just an
interconnection of things.

36
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,730
And those devices, we'll just
simplify, in their computers--

37
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,559
though very much in vogue these
days is IOT or internet of things.

38
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:29,850
Which means like every stupid
little thing in the world

39
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,010
is going to be on the
internet for some reason.

40
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,170
So that's trendy right now.

41
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,687
But for today we'll just
focus on devices or computers.

42
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,270
And what does it mean to network them.

43
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,640
Well, back in the day it meant
physically connecting them with cables,

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,017
so that you could actually have a
physical connection between devices.

45
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:45,850
Nowadays, we, of course,
have these antennas

46
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,007
on the wall called access
points, or Wi-Fi routers,

47
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:50,590
or any number of other names for them.

48
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,700
But that allows us to all
transmit data wirelessly.

49
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,730
So that might give us locally what
we call a local area network or LAN.

50
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,870
People don't say that as
much anymore but that's

51
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,120
what a local area network is.

52
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,730
You also have WLAN, which is a wireless
local area network, which probably

53
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,850
even fewer people say these days.

54
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,120
But these are indeed local networks.

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,240
So what is the internet?

56
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,990
Well, the internet is really
just a network of networks.

57
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,680
So we might think of this campus,
of course, as being Harvard.edu.

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,010
Down the road is MIT.edu.

59
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,990
Across the country is stanford.edu.

60
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,169
Not to mention all of the many
companies and universities and homes

61
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:26,960
that are out there.

62
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,970
And so all of those, if
they're interconnected,

63
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,420
indeed give us the
internet or inter-network.

64
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,170
All right.

65
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,290
So how does it work?

66
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,590
So I've just walked into
this room a little bit ago.

67
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,540
I open my laptop screen.

68
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,020
And somehow I'm magically
on the internet.

69
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,870
I'm connected to the internet.

70
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,370
But a few steps had to precede that.

71
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,870
Some of you engaged in those steps while
you were here on campus this weekend,

72
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,370
or first thing this morning by
following some of the instructions.

73
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,286
What was one of the first
things you had to do

74
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,990
according to the instructions
in this booklet today?

75
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,240
You had to connect and log on.

76
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,531
So most of you probably have the
intuitive-- the instincts these days,

77
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,030
when you want to connect on
Wi-Fi, you go to your Wi-Fi menu

78
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,375
in the top right or bottom
right corner of your screen,

79
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,000
whatever operating system you're using.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,850
And you choose either the most
familiar or the most unlocked network

81
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,127
that you possibly can
and try to get online.

82
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:16,710
Sometimes you're asked for a password.

83
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,630
Sometimes you aren't.

84
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,840
And that may or may not have
some actual implications

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
that we'll perhaps scratch
the surface of today.

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,570
Or talk about in more detail
tomorrow morning with security.

87
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,090
But what then happened thereafter?

88
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,650
Well, it turns out that every computer
on the internet has a unique address.

89
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,340
A unique IP address.

90
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,870
I'll just toss up jargon here as
we discuss some of these things.

91
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,230
IP stands for internet protocol.

92
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,820
And it's just a convention for
assigning numeric addresses

93
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,020
to most every computer on the internet.

94
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,500
So we right now are at One Brattle
Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

95
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,440
01238.

96
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,360
But that pretty much
uniquely identifies us.

97
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,010
Especially if we tack on the room
number or the floor number and so forth.

98
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,910
And so that's how the
mail-- the post office

99
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,010
actually gets mail uniquely to
this particular destination.

100
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,300
So my laptop too isn't addressed, of
course, by nature of postal addresses,

101
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,180
but by way of numeric addresses.

102
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,610
Just because computers kind
of prefer numeric addresses.

103
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,936
Turns out, fun fact, that these
are 32-bit addresses mostly.

104
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:19,769
And that means we can have how many
total computers on the internet?

105
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,730


106
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,050
2 to the 32.

107
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,020
Nice way to punt there.

108
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,490
Four billion roughly.

109
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,310
So 2 to the 32 or four billion.

110
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,662
Which actually these
days isn't all that many,

111
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,620
if you consider all of
the humans in the world,

112
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,370
and all of the laptops
and desktops and phones.

113
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,520
And again, because of internet of
things, every toaster and thermostats.

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,640
And any number of other devices.

115
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,040
So the world has been transitioning
away from something called IPv4, which

116
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,630
is version 4, the version we've been
using for decades right now, to IPv6.

117
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,120
Which has been around for
a while, but no one really

118
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,390
got around to implementing
it until really recent years.

119
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,950
At least on any kind of scale, with
big companies like Google and Comcast

120
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,400
and the like finally starting to give
people not just 32-bit addresses,

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,660
but-- anyone want to take a guess
what comes after 64-- uh, dammit.

122
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,170
What comes after 32-bit addresses?

123
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,860
No.

124
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,750
128-bit addresses, actually.

125
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,020
So I don't even know why I said that.

126
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,640
128-bit addresses.

127
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,940
Which is kind of unprecedented.

128
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,560
Rarely do humans actually
have the foresight

129
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,200
to not just go one notch above but two
notches above where we currently are.

130
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,240
And so 128-bit addresses means that we
really can have an internet of things.

131
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,420
If I pull up my massive calculator here.

132
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,100
2 to the 32, of course, gives
us four billion computers.

133
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,130
2 to the 128, also
unpronounceable by me.

134
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,930
That's a lot of devices.

135
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,440
That's a lot of things on the internet.

136
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,340
So we've got a lot of
IP addresses available,

137
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,939
at least in the works right now.

138
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,730
So what does it mean
to have an IP address?

139
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,050
Well, once my computer
has an IP address--

140
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,080
and how it gets that
we'll come back to-- I

141
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,990
can now communicate on the network.

142
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,320
And indeed the way devices
on the network work

143
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,280
is essentially you
can think of computers

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,040
as sending envelopes of information.

145
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,300
So here's like an old
school envelope here.

146
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,740
And on this in the human
world we might typically

147
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,855
put a to address and a from address.

148
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:16,730
And those would be
physical postal addresses.

149
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,440
But in the digital
world, of course, it's

150
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,570
going to be a numeric address, in
both the to field and the from field.

151
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:24,480
Which is to say that both I and
the recipient of any information I

152
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,200
send on the internet has got
to have such a numeric address.

153
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,800
So Amazon has such an address,
Google has such an address.

154
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,170
And actually those
bigger fish in the world

155
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,230
tend to often have
multiple IP addresses.

156
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,280
And we can see this.

157
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,720
So first on Mac OS, let me go to
System Preferences and Network.

158
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,070
And Windows has an analog as well.

159
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,660
I'm going to click Advanced, and
I'm going to click on TCP/IP.

160
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,320
And indeed, you can see that my
computer has currently the IP address

161
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,690
10.254.16.128 and a whole
bunch of other things.

162
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,530
So that is the unique address
for my computer right now.

163
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,080
And I should really say unique address.

164
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,780
Because it turns out that
even though much of the world

165
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,720
still uses IPv4 or 32-bit
addresses, the world also

166
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,470
has started using a technology
for some time now called NAT.

167
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,430
Does anyone use this technology at home?

168
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,040


169
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,360
David?

170
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,060
I do.

171
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,601
This is one of those trick questions.

172
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,030
Like who has internet at home?

173
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,475
OK so with very-- and how many
people have Wi-Fi at home?

174
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:28,150
Almost everyone?

175
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,650
OK.

176
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,430
So with very, very high probability,
all of us in this room use NAT.

177
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,920
NAT is network address translation.

178
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,050
And what this means is that
whether your ISP-- internet service

179
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:45,106
provider-- is Comcast or RCN or Verizon
or any number of other companies,

180
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:46,980
probably when they
installed it in your house

181
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,688
they gave you some
kind of little device.

182
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:50,622
A little router as it might be called.

183
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:52,080
Although they have different names.

184
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,246
Sometimes they're wireless,
sometimes they're wired.

185
00:07:54,246 --> 00:07:57,740
But connected to that is probably a
telephone line or a coaxial cable,

186
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,400
like your cable box and so forth.

187
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,510
And that is what gives
your house internet access.

188
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,430
And that device comes with
typically one IP address.

189
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,050
And that IP address is
associated with that machine.

190
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,200
The problem, of course, is that most of
us have a phone and a laptop or desktop

191
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,740
or roommates or parents or
siblings or kids, all of whom

192
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,041
themselves have devices.

193
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,790
And so it would be
unfortunate if you only

194
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,830
had one unique address for
all of you if only one of you

195
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,950
could therefore be on
the internet at a time.

196
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,870
NAT came about-- network
address translation--

197
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,040
because it's a feature
of modern hardware

198
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,020
that allows you to have
one IP address for that one

199
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,460
device, the router you bought or
leased from Comcast or the like.

200
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,590
But behind that device,
your home network-- a.k.a.

201
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,400
LAN-- you can have
all dozens of devices,

202
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,840
if not hundreds of devices,
all having not that public IP

203
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,410
address, but private IP addresses.

204
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,930
And so network address translation
essentially works like this.

205
00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:00,090
If this here is your home, and you have
a little box from Verizon or Comcast.

206
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,130
And this here is the internet.

207
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,560
This device here is your home router.

208
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,380


209
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,360
And it has a public IP on this side.

210
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,850
And inside the house are let's
say many private IP addresses.

211
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,150
One for each of the
devices in your homes.

212
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:26,396
And so any time you send a request from
your laptop for CNN.com or Google.com

213
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:30,020
or Facebook.com or the like,
that request initially,

214
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,230
by nature of the wires or Wi-Fi in your
house, first go through that device.

215
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,430
Because it's the only point
coming in or going out

216
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,190
to your internet service provider.

217
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,080
It looks at your from address, which
is going to be a private address.

218
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,690
Which just means it's not meant
to be public on the internet.

219
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,620
It quickly crosses that out.

220
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,580
This device puts its
own public IP address

221
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,110
that you get from Comcast or
Verizon where the from field

222
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,452
used to be on that envelope.

223
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:55,660
Sends it out on the internet.

224
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,850
Google or Facebook or whoever respond.

225
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,540
That response comes to that
little device in your home.

226
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,310
Your little device in your
home checks its records.

227
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,120
Saying hm, who requested this piece
of information a split second ago?

228
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,140
It crosses out the to field,
which was sent to the public IP.

229
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,070
Puts in the private address of
the laptop or desktop or phone

230
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,220
in your home that
originally requested it.

231
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,910
And all of this happens
nearly instantaneously.

232
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,710
So we don't even notice the difference.

233
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,270
But as a result of this network
address translation from public IP

234
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,980
to private IP addresses,
plural, do we have the ability

235
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,250
to put multiple devices
on the network at once.

236
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,220
It wasn't all that long
ago, 20 or so years ago,

237
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,090
when if you wanted to have two
computers on the network at home,

238
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,920
someone like Comcast or RCN would
just charge you twice or three times

239
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,354
to actually give you dedicated
devices or IP addresses.

240
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:46,020
So this is actually a wonderful feature.

241
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,900
And it has the side effect also
of firewalling your computer.

242
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,670
And this is why these terms
get so commingled these days.

243
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,875
A firewall in the real world is
like a physical wall between stores,

244
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,500
especially in strip malls and the like.

245
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,440
So that if one shop gets on
fire, the other's next to it

246
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
with high probability are safe.

247
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,800
Because the fire can't
get through the firewall.

248
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,990
In the virtual world,
you have firewalls that

249
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,350
are software, that are
designed to keep data

250
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,510
from the outside coming in or
perhaps from the inside going out.

251
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,490
And so the fact that there is this
translation from public to private

252
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,690
also means as a side effect,
typically, that if you

253
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,310
have some adversary, some bad
guy on the internet trying

254
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,220
to get at your laptop or desktop in your
home, he or she can't actually do that.

255
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,780
Because the only way you
can talk to a private IP

256
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,940
address is if the request were
initiated from the inside out.

257
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,620
Now, you can firewall your home and your
business even more securely than that.

258
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,340
And we'll come back to that
as we discuss security itself.

259
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,990
And there are ways around the
scenario I just described.

260
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,500
But that tends to be a side effect.

261
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,416
It's a good thing, actually, there's
this network address translation.

262
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:53,940
Because it means people can't very
easily get in from the outside.

263
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,680
The downside of that is that if
you're trying to run your own web

264
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,630
server-- for instance, you're
trying to start a company

265
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,630
or you're building a website, and you
want friends or associates or just

266
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,980
customers to be able to access your
website and it's inside your home,

267
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,750
odds are they're not
going to be able to.

268
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,770
Because you can't talk
to a private IP address

269
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,020
from the outside world in unless
you configure your home network

270
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,190
or your office network
especially for that.

271
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,650
So there's some interesting layers
of protection that are in here.

272
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,060
Also on the screen here are
a couple of other addresses.

273
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,820
So router.

274
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,790
Let's come here.

275
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,350
I just drew the internet
as this big cloud.

276
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,790
Sort of which has become
cloud computing these days.

277
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,490
But what is the internet itself?

278
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,090
Or what really gets data
from point A to point B?

279
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,670
If this is me at home,
and this is Amazon.com,

280
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,360
how do I actually get data
to and from Amazon.com?

281
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,770
Well, I certainly don't have a Wi-Fi
connection to Amazon in Seattle

282
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,990
or wherever they are.

283
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,830
I certainly don't have a dedicated
wire from my laptop to Amazon.

284
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,060
So once the data leaves
my laptop, where does it

285
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,400
go if I'm trying to shop on Amazon.com?

286
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,865


287
00:12:57,865 --> 00:12:58,780
To a cable?

288
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,280
OK.

289
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,491
So some cable somewhere.

290
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:00,990
Indeed.

291
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,120
And my laptop probably
is talking wireless

292
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,870
to some of these antennas in the room.

293
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,870
Those antennas-- even
though you don't see them,

294
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,245
because they've been mounted
pretty cleanly on the wall--

295
00:13:09,245 --> 00:13:12,360
do have an ethernet cable that
is quite like this thing here.

296
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,060
It's like a thicker phone cable, if you
remember what phone cables are like.

297
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,580
This is an RJ45 connector.

298
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,190
Phone cables are RJ11, which
just means their size and specs.

299
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,530
But that thing in the wall
is somehow connected probably

300
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,530
to a device called a switch.

301
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,500
So that thing is called
an access point or AP.

302
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,990
Switches are fairly
dumb devices that just

303
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,570
have a lot of phone
jack like connectors,

304
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,004
a lot of ethernet connectors.

305
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,920
That once you plug in
all the ethernet cables,

306
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,020
the devices can all inter-communicate
with minimal amount of security.

307
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:49,250
And from there, the switch is connected
to probably one of Harvard's routers.

308
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,270
What is a router?

309
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,110
Guess even if you've
never heard the term.

310
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,300
A router routes information.

311
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,800
Yeah.

312
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,690
It really is that.

313
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,000
So you can think of
the internet as being

314
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,670
speckled with a whole bunch of routers
represented by those dots there.

315
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,960
And there are edges between
these dots or these nodes.

316
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,720
And what's interesting
about the internet

317
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,140
is that data doesn't necessarily
travel one predictable path or even

318
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,220
one same path on subsequent requests.

319
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,740
It's sort of this mesh network, whereby
each of those nodes is a router,

320
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,090
each of those dots is a router.

321
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,640
Each of the edges is just
a point of connectivity,

322
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,870
wired typically or wireless.

323
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,930
And so data can travel from point
A to point B by getting relayed

324
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,460
by all of these different routers.

325
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,450
And so when a router receives
a packet like this one here,

326
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:44,280
it looks at the to address and sees,
oh, this is destined for 1.2.3.4.

327
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,500
I know where that server is.

328
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
It's that way.

329
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,050
And so the router routes
the packet this way.

330
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,960
The next router in
turn might look at this

331
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,980
and be like, oh, I know
where this machine is.

332
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,650
It's that way.

333
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,160
And so it might hand this
off to the next router.

334
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,490
And by nature of how the
internet is configured,

335
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:05,120
typically it requires a max of 30 or so
hops, hand-offs, to get from one point

336
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,060
A to one point B around
the entire world.

337
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,550
And typically it's far fewer than that.

338
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,300
And it is the routers that decide how
to get the data with high probability

339
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,170
closer and closer and closer.

340
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,824
Not necessarily geographically.

341
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,990
Sometimes it's faster to
take a different direction.

342
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,710
Sometimes it's less expensive
to take a different direction.

343
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,160
But eventually the data actually
makes its way from point A to point B.

344
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,330
Indeed, you can see here
the IP address of a router.

345
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,580
Which of the routers in this
story is this IP address?

346
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,637
10.254.16.1.

347
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,720
And notice the similarity.

348
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,100
My IP address is almost the
same, but ends with 128.

349
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,840
Router IP addresses often, by human
convention, end with the number .1.

350
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,850
So you know that they're
on the same network.

351
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,880
Where is this router?

352
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,290
Whose router is this?

353
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,140
Or where in the story
is it would you think?

354
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,800
Harvard, yeah.

355
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,200
It's probably quite
proximal to this building.

356
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,390
Maybe it's in the basement.

357
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,840
Maybe it's around the corner.

358
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,000
It's one of Harvard's
routers presumably.

359
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,140
And in turn, that has some kind of
connectivity to these other routers

360
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,760
as well.

361
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,317
Typically these edges, these left right
decisions are dynamically configured.

362
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:15,400
So that if you unplug a router-- which
wouldn't typically happen but could

363
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,070
happen-- or if one router gets
congested, special protocols, software

364
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,150
that these routers are
running will dynamically

365
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,100
figure out which is the better or
newer or correct way to send the data.

366
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,970
And so it's all very
adaptive without humans

367
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,650
necessarily having to get involved.

368
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,480
Yeah?

371
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:37,630
DAVID J. MALAN: Totally depends.

372
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,130
And it's different people along the way.

373
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,450
So Harvard, of course, owns
it's one or more routers.

374
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,960
I, in my home, might own
my tiny little router.

375
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,050
Which really can just
get data out of my home.

376
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,390
In the middle are lots of internet
service providers, big and small.

377
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,640
Level three is a very big one.

378
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,570
Verizon and Comcast have
their own networks as well.

379
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,040
There is yet other bigger fish.

380
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,069
Google has its own fiber
network and so forth--

383
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:04,880
DAVID J. MALAN: Money.

384
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,520
They're peering points, so to speak.

385
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,359
So these larger internet
service providers typically

386
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,579
have financial agreements
between them that

387
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,250
govern how much they will pay
to send their data this way

388
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,500
or that way in order to get
data from one place to another.

389
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,092
They themselves are internally
incentivized to actually relay

390
00:17:20,092 --> 00:17:21,800
the data to someone
if they actually want

391
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,849
to have customers whose data
can go from point A to point B.

392
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,550
And so sometimes the decisions to go
either to the left or to the right,

393
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,300
so to speak, might be made not so
much on technological decisions

394
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,200
but just on business decisions.

395
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,420
To whom do we have appearing connection?

396
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,150
And so even if you as a
business owner, for instance,

397
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,820
want to bring your-- run
your own servers, which

398
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,060
isn't as common an instinct these
days with cloud computing all

399
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,770
the rage-- more on that later-- if you
might have your own servers in a data

400
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,410
center in some warehouse out in
Western Massachusetts or New Jersey

401
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,720
or those kinds of places,
you would typically

402
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,200
decide for yourself who do you
want to pay to physically run

403
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,870
a cable into your servers, into
your part of the data center,

404
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,340
to establish exactly one
of those connections.

405
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,220
And that too would be a financial
decision and a reputation decision.

406
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,440
And not so much a technology one.

407
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,311
Yeah, David?

410
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,860
DAVID J. MALAN: Ah, a good question.

411
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,950
Why wouldn't you just have one
router and lots of switches

412
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,160
for the whole campus?

413
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,350
Part of it is distributed management.

414
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,090
So Harvard, for
instance, is a big place.

415
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,360
So let me oversimplify and say
each of the schools to some extent

416
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,370
might run its own local
network so that they

417
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,244
can have their own policies, their
own infrastructure, and so forth.

418
00:18:42,244 --> 00:18:44,410
But they want to interconnect
to the rest of campus.

419
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,860
These days, Harvard
has been transitioning

420
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,792
to having more of a
monolithic infrastructure.

421
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,500
But there are still
side effects of this.

422
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,958
For instance, in a couple of
the offices that I spend time,

423
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:57,300
we can't actually-- we can have the
offices talk to one another certainly.

424
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,720
But we can't create
the illusion of what's

425
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,700
called a VLAN or virtual local area
network, whereby two separate buildings

426
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,360
appear to be the same network.

427
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,060
Simply because of legacy and
actual hardware limitations.

428
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,760
There's also performance.

429
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,410
For instance internal to campus,
there's only so much traffic.

430
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,993
But there's certainly a bottleneck
when you're leaving campus.

431
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,350
So you might have want to
have a separate route, a more

432
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,880
souped up router, that can actually
handle that outbound traffic.

433
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,338
Whereas you have smaller less
expensive routers internally.

434
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:32,330
And so it boils down to those kinds
of economic and logistical decisions.

435
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,240
Good question.

436
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,900
There's also security implications too.

437
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,152
A switch typically
operates technologically

438
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:38,860
at a certain level
that doesn't allow you

439
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,220
the same amount of control over what
comes in and out of your network.

440
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,720
Whereas a router is more of a
deliberate bottleneck that you have more

441
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,399
control over.

442
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,440
But the line is blurred
to some extent these days

443
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,470
between routers and
switches and their features.

444
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,040
As an aside.

445
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,260
This is a more arcane detail.

446
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,660
But does anyone-- has anyone
probably seen subnet mask before?

447
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,869
Someone know what subnet mask before is?

448
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:02,910
We don't have to get too
far into the weeds here.

449
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,640
But that is simply a number
that allows the local computer--

450
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,730
my Mac in this case-- to decide
when it is sending data from point A

451
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:18,640
to some other point B, if that other
computer is on the same local network

452
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,260
or if it's elsewhere on the internet.

453
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,980
And so essentially this
subnet mask, 255.255.240.0,

454
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,200
represents a pattern of ones and zeros.

455
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,260
It uses that patterns of ones
and zeros to determine, hm,

456
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,710
I am trying to request or send
information to this other server.

457
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,040
If that pattern of one
and zeros tells my Mac

458
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,030
that, ooh, that other computer is
on the local network, what's nice

459
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,730
is my computer will use a different
approach, a different protocol,

460
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,550
ethernet specifically, to
actually get the data from point A

461
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,180
to point B. It will never go
out on the public internet.

462
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,380
By contrast, if that
number reveals, oh, this

463
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,010
is actually a computer
that's far away, that's

464
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,310
how the computer decides to send
it not to the local network, LAN,

465
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:02,160
but to the next router
instead, to that IP.

466
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,710
So it all boils down to what
do you write on the envelope?

467
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,870
The local address or the
router's address instead.

468
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,440
So let's see if we can't see this.

469
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,290
Let me try to pull up.

470
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,960
Give me just one moment to see
if I can get into a server here

471
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,270
that will let us do this.

472
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,422
Nope, that won't do it.

473
00:21:19,422 --> 00:21:23,060


474
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,990
That doesn't work.

475
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:31,085


476
00:21:31,085 --> 00:21:32,420
Give me one moment.

477
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:44,850


478
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,430
Come on.

479
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,504


480
00:21:50,504 --> 00:21:51,545
All right, let's do this.

481
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:58,800


482
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,300
All right.

483
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,370
Let's see if this works.

484
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,350
And then I'll explain
what we're doing here.

485
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:02,850
Whoops.

486
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,700


487
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,420
Transfer out.

488
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:18,640


489
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,140
All right.

490
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,680
Let's see if this gives me what I want.

491
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,084
Turn this around.

492
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,980


493
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,750
OK, this works.

494
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,980


495
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,720
OK.

496
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,790
So let's go ahead and
try this as follows.

497
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,290
-q 1.

498
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,880


499
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,950
OK, perfect.

500
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:43,050
MIT is seven hops away.

501
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:43,960
What did I just do?

502
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,490
So this is a command line program,
a text-based program on my Mac--

503
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:53,680
though an equivalent exists for PCs as
well-- and I ran traceroutes query one.

504
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,940
So just give me, send one request
at a time, to www.MIT.edu.

505
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,910
Because I am technically
interested in how data gets from

506
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,170
point A here at my laptop to
point B at MIT down the road.

507
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:08,080
And it turns out that
as we saw a moment ago,

508
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,790
the first hop that my data takes in
order to talk to MIT's web server

509
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,610
is to that address.

510
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,310
Which is the IP of what again?

511
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,270
Yeah, the router that my Mac
was preconfigured to use.

512
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,910
I don't recognize hop two.

513
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,930
It's just some other IP address.

514
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,310
But I do know it's also private.

515
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,400
It turns out that any IP address
that starts with the number 10

516
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,840
is a private IP address.

517
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,960
So you know it's being administered
locally by Harvard or by a family

518
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,750
member or someone in your company.

519
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,570
And if you're curious, this
is an inexhaustive list.

520
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,260
But anything ending in 10 dot something,
anything ending in-- starting with

521
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:52,510
172.16.something, anything
starting with 192.168.something.

522
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,390
So indeed if you go home
tonight or this coming week

523
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,720
and try to find your own Mac or PC's
IP address at home, or even at work,

524
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,410
perhaps, odds are it starts
with one of these values.

525
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,780
These are private IPs that
are, by human decision years

526
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,670
ago, never to appear
on the public internet.

527
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,400
They're meant to be used in homes and
businesses and campuses and the like.

528
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,691
So I know that one and two
are somewhere here on campus

529
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:14,490
because they have private IP addresses.

530
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,890
But then step 3 and 4 get
interesting because they have

531
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,290
what are called host names.

532
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:24,180
Semi-human friendly names that look
like domain names, and indeed they are.

533
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,719
And I know it's Harvard for sure.

534
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,510
But I don't know really
know where this is.

535
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,120
I do see its IP address.

536
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,580
This is a public IP
address at this point.

537
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,730
And I only know from convention,
coregw means core gateway.

538
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,610
Gateway as a synonym for router.

539
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,160
So this is like a core
router at Harvard.

540
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,380
So it's a really important router at
Harvard is as much as I can glean.

541
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,880
And what's interesting is that it
took three milliseconds for my data

542
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,240
to reach that router.

543
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,200
It took 1.75 for it to
reach the second router.

544
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,300
And two milliseconds to
reach the first router.

545
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,651
And what strikes you
about these three values?

546
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:01,567
Especially since I read
them in reverse order.

547
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:05,046


548
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

549
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,910
DAVID J. MALAN: What's that?

550
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,951
They're not all the same.

551
00:25:07,951 --> 00:25:10,504
So there's a lot of
variability or non-determinism

552
00:25:10,504 --> 00:25:12,420
when it comes to sending
data on the internet.

553
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,280
The routers might be slightly
more busy at some times or other.

554
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,020
And by busy I mean maybe
more people are sending data.

555
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,390
And so it takes a moment
for the router to figure out

556
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,306
all of the different
decisions it has to make.

557
00:25:22,306 --> 00:25:24,736
And that slows down my data
or someone else's data.

558
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,860
These are all pretty close.

559
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,997
They're all essentially
two, three milliseconds.

560
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:29,080
So it's still pretty fast.

561
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,532
But that variability is to be expected.

562
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:32,740
And these are not cumulative.

563
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,510
What this program is doing is it's
kind of putting its toe in the water

564
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,270
a little deeper and deeper each time.

565
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,010
How fast can I get to the first hop?

566
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,150
Then to the second hop?

567
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,220
Than to the third hop?

568
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,530
So it's progressively going.

569
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,050
They're not additive times.

570
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:51,190
Step four is another router that I just
know from convention is Border Gateway.

571
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,880
So this is probably another router
that Harvard owns that's on the border.

572
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,490
So figuratively speaking, the
edge, or maybe literally speaking,

573
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,680
the edge of campus.

574
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,040
Then it looks like Harvard's
internet service provider is Quest,

575
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
which is a really big ISP as well.

576
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,170
Like level 3 and others,
to your question earlier.

577
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,290
So Quest would be one of our
peers to whom we connect.

578
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:18,680
It looks like they have at least
two routers that are curiously

579
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,130
named the same in the same address.

580
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,850
I do not know why that is happening.

581
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,870
That seems to be a quirk
or a bug of some sort.

582
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,350
And then curiously, it
looks like MIT's website

583
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,800
has been outsourced to a company
that you might know of called Akamai.

584
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,470
They, among other things, are
a CDN content delivery network.

585
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,980
Which just means they run servers for
people to store their static files on.

586
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,220
So that MIT doesn't have to run its own
web servers, its own physical machines.

587
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,060
They just pay Akamai some number
of dollars per month or per year

588
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,935
to store it for them.

589
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:51,518
I have no idea what this number means.

590
00:26:51,518 --> 00:26:53,580
It's probably just a
unique random identifier.

591
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,014
And this is apparently where
people deploy stuff too.

592
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:56,930
So that's all we know.

593
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:01,470
But it took 7 milliseconds to get to
MIT, as opposed to a good 15-20 minutes

594
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,247
by car or by [? T ?]
or by bike from here.

595
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,580
All right, so let's try another.

596
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,900
Trace route to Stanford.edu
and let's see what changes.

597
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,610
Same initial path, but now
step 5 is a little different.

598
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:19,380


599
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,600
The stars generally mean that
the router, for whatever reason

600
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
of misconfiguration or
deliberate security,

601
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,240
is just not responding to
the queries I'm sending.

602
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,680
So it's sort of anonymous.

603
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,760
Unfortunately, there
aren't many named router

604
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,825
as it seems between us and Stanford.edu.

605
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:42,390


606
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,600
And there's a lot of
anonymity between us and them.

607
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,010
So it started off somewhat
interesting, and now is

608
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,080
devolving into not very interesting.

609
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,750
Let's try someone else.

610
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,302
UCBerkeley.ed--

611
00:27:54,302 --> 00:27:56,910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

612
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,010
DAVID J. MALAN: Oh, we'll get there.

613
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,770
Berkeley.edu.

614
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,050
This one's juicier.

615
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,450
OK.

616
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,110
So what do we see here?

617
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,410
So here's-- this was new.

618
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,226
Nox, this is the northern crossroads.

619
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:14,350
This is a really big peering point
where lots of different internet service

620
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,260
providers interconnect in the Northeast.

621
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,430
Northern crossroads--
it looks like internet2,

622
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,410
the internet2 is a network
used primarily by universities

623
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,470
to be super fast, to
allow them to share data

624
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,090
and information in silly little
tests like this more effectively.

625
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:34,720
It looks like, curiously,
that step eight and nine

626
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,270
are kind of showing their
hand as to where they are.

627
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,000
Notice what changes between
step seven and eight What's

628
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,595
striking about these two routers?

629
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,860


630
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,680
What's different?

631
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

632
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,380
DAVID J. MALAN: I'm sorry?

633
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,960
The time really jumps, right, from
seven milliseconds-- previous to that

634
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,930
was four and two, two, two milliseconds.

635
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,920
Now it's 50 milliseconds.

636
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,930
Where might step eight be?

637
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

638
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:04,900
DAVID J. MALAN: What's that?

639
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,274
It's not a private versus public.

640
00:29:06,274 --> 00:29:08,390
In fact, pretty much
everything right now

641
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,640
is public, by nature
of it being routers.

642
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,410
Right now everything you're
seeing is inside this internet.

643
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,019
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

644
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:17,310
DAVID J. MALAN: Distance, yeah.

645
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,565
And it turns out that you can
sometimes infer from the host name,

646
00:29:20,565 --> 00:29:22,690
just because of human
conventions for naming things

647
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,830
that step eight, that router, is
probably physically in Houston,

648
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,771
I'm guessing?

649
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:27,270
Texas.

650
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,454
So it's a good distance away from
wherever step seven actually was.

651
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:32,620
I'm not sure where it is
but probably the Northeast.

652
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,280
Meanwhile, step 10 is even
farther from step nine,

653
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm guessing, because
of another jump in time.

654
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,010
Where might step 10 be?

655
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,010
LAX?

656
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,930
For whatever reason,
system administrators

657
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,570
have historically liked
naming routers after airports.

658
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,680
So this is probably in LA.

659
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,930
This one here, svl.

660
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,660
Still LAX.

661
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,340
I don't know what that is,
so I'll go with the LAX.

662
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,048
And then finally,
we've reached Berkeley.

663
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:03,850
And then for some reason, it's
just not responding further.

664
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,010
So it takes about 90 milliseconds
to send data to Berkeley.

665
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:12,970
Or about 5 or 6 hours to fly to Berkeley
to put things into sort of human terms.

666
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,680
And indeed, I think-- someone
suggested something abroad.

667
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,750
If we do like CNN.co.jp, the
Japanese version of CNN's website,

668
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,120
let's see if it cooperates here.

669
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,490
So again, we seem to have
taken the same direction.

670
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,160
A little anonymity there.

671
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,680
And then some really
interesting stuff going on

672
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,610
in step seven, eight, nine, and 10.

673
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,490
Massive jump here.

674
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:44,060
What might explain the striking increase
in time between hops nine and 10?

675
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,830
Pacific what?

676
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,260
Yeah, so the Pacific Ocean.

677
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,120
So indeed, there's huge
trans-Atlantic cables.

678
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,600
And trans-Pacific cables.

679
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,630
And just generally, oceanic cables that
carry a huge amount of internet traffic

680
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,280
that really big ships just slowly drag
and leave at the bottom of the ocean.

681
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,840
And indeed, it might take
100 additional milliseconds

682
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,340
to go from maybe California, can't
really tell from the names here

683
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,700
alone, to the coast of
Japan so many miles away.

684
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,020
So you can get a sense
there of distance as well.

685
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,540
And meanwhile, let's see
if we do-- one last one,

686
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:22,687
let's do like Yale.edu which is still
on this coast, and see what we get.

687
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:24,520
Here too we're going
to get similar results.

688
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,780
So nine or so milliseconds alone.

689
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,289
So this puts into more real
terms what's actually going on.

690
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,080
And a system administrator,
if he or she is

691
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,980
trying to diagnose some
issue with a network,

692
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,480
this is actually a real tool
that real people might actually

693
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,390
use to figure out where
is the data flowing.

694
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,650
Is one of the millisecond
counts way bigger than others,

695
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,960
is it anomalously large?

696
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,414
That might mean that one
router is malfunctioning

697
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:45,830
or it's just completely congested.

698
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,070
And so this is just one
such diagnostic tool.

699
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,570
But another one that's
useful to play with is this.

700
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,190
I proposed earlier that
people like Google.com

701
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,710
not have one IP address
publicly identifying them.

702
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,820
And indeed, if we hit
Google.com, in this case--

703
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,940
let's see if I'm about
to prove my point or not.

704
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,270
Nope.

705
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:02,770
OK.

706
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,960
Google has just one IP address.

707
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,886
Which is 172.217.0.46, which
is a little misleading.

708
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,010
But let's see what happens.

709
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,320
htp:// and that IP address.

710
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,510
And indeed, it brings
me to Google's website.

711
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,640
So if Google has this one IP address--
which does not demonstrate the point

712
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,220
I was hoping to make-- why
do they not just advertise

713
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:34,105
their URL as http://172.217.0.46?

714
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:35,230
Right, it's not meaningful.

715
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,320
I can't even read it,
let alone memorize it.

716
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,351
But this is kind of an interesting
upgrade from yesteryear.

717
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:41,850
Right?

718
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,224
Back in the day, some of us
might remember 1-800-COLLECT.

719
00:32:44,224 --> 00:32:47,410
800 Which to this day, I don't
know what number that is.

720
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:52,190
But I know the mnemonic allowed
me to remember how to dial it,

721
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,070
so long as there's a mapping on the
phone pad to letters in this case.

722
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,570
And this is what DNS is for
the internet, essentially.

723
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,650
But it's automatic.

724
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,352
DNS is domain name system.

725
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:05,060
Which is to say that there are
special servers in the world whose

726
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,560
purpose in life is to translate numeric
addresses to fully qualified domain

727
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,060
names.

728
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,660
Host names like
Google.com and vice versa.

729
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,360
So we humans only have to remember,
and even our computers initially only

730
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,990
have to write the domain
name that the human provided.

731
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,940
And some other server, a
DNS server, will actually

732
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,270
do the automatic conversion.

733
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,780
And actually write at the end
of the day the numeric address

734
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,410
on the so-called virtual envelope.

735
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,681
But where-- David?

736
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:32,556
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

737
00:33:32,556 --> 00:33:36,564


738
00:33:36,564 --> 00:33:37,980
DAVID J. MALAN: You would hope so.

739
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,150
Not in this case, though.

740
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,280
So DNS also is a distributed system.

741
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,060
And it's a hierarchical system.

742
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,620
Which means there's lots
of caching that happens.

743
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,481
So it would be-- in
the extreme scenario,

744
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:51,980
suppose there is just one DNS
server in the world that knows

745
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,590
about all IP addresses and all names.

746
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,800
What's the downside of
that design intuitively?

747
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,540
If it goes down, gets jammed,
can't handle all of the traffic.

748
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,730
So that just feels like bad design,
whether or not you're an engineer.

749
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,610
So the DNS system has multiple servers.

750
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,790
But it doesn't just have duplicative
server, it has a hierarchical system.

751
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,779
So that there are some servers,
typically by convention, at least 13

752
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:19,929
root servers, whose purpose in life
isn't to know all of the answers,

753
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,190
but to know who has the answers.

754
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,250
And the root servers might know
who would know the answers for all

755
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,800
of the .com's, for all of the .gov's,
for all of the .jp's, and so forth.

756
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,080
Meanwhile, there is-- if
you think of a family tree.

757
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,030
If the root servers
are up here, you have

758
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,750
a second tier of servers
whose purpose in life

759
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,190
is to know those actual answers.

760
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,870
Or if they don't, to
know whom to ask in turn.

761
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,020
And that goes all the
way down to my laptop.

762
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,626
For efficiency purposes, when my
Mac first requests Google.com,

763
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:52,928
it obviously does not
know the IP address.

764
00:34:52,928 --> 00:34:56,219
Because Apple did not ship this in every
Mac with the IP address of Google.com,

765
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,790
especially since it might change day to
day or week to week or a year to year.

766
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,010
But Harvard does have a DNS server.

767
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,670
But Harvard doesn't know the answers
to all IP addresses and host names

768
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,260
in the world.

769
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,087
But Harvard has it so its own internet
service provider that it could ask.

770
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:14,420
And maybe that internet service provider
has a bigger internet service provider.

771
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,830
And if that person doesn't
know, then at least

772
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,420
the root servers can help us
figure out who would actually know.

773
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,560
But along the way, once my Mac gets
that answer back the first time,

774
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,010
by convention, Mac OS and Windows
are going to remember or cache

775
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,700
the answer locally.

776
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,972
And why would they do that?

777
00:35:30,972 --> 00:35:33,750


778
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,230
So you don't have to ask it again.

779
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,438
Which is good for efficiency.

780
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:38,270
And frankly, even browsers do this too.

781
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,550
Like Chrome and Internet
Explorer might actually

782
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,740
remember that information locally
along with other information as well.

783
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,060
So there's lots of layers
of caching for efficiency.

784
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,150
Of course, a side effect of this, if
you put back on the engineering hat,

785
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,691
what could go wrong if you're
caching information, especially

786
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,088
at multiple layers?

787
00:35:53,088 --> 00:35:54,451
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

788
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:57,200
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, it makes it
really genuinely hard for Google

789
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,660
to change its IP.

790
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,220
Because if they change it,
well, when do they change it?

791
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,070
Well, if they change
it right now, my laptop

792
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,640
might remember the old IP address
for multiple minutes, hours, days.

793
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,430
It depends on how it was
configured or misconfigured.

794
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,020
So what does Google then do?

795
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,142
Well, maybe they could
do it late at night.

796
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:15,850
Unfortunately, Google
is a global company

797
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,390
and there is every possible time zone.

798
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,390
So just doing it at night
really has no meaning.

799
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,490
So that's not a solution.

800
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,190
They could run two servers in parallel.

801
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,000
Or at least two servers in parallel.

802
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,820
One with the old IP,
one with the new IP.

803
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,730
That gets us by.

804
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,820
But then we're getting new data on
both servers which probably isn't good

805
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,160
if we're trying to move to
some new server with an IP.

806
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,320
So this is actually a massive,
massive challenge these days.

807
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,530
And one of the ways that companies
like Google avoid this is one,

808
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,710
they only have one IP address.

809
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,360
And they use it as sort of the entry
point to the entire infrastructure.

810
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,910
So that hopefully, Google never has
to change this IP address, certainly

811
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,960
not frequently.

812
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,740
But they can change any number of
servers that are behind that IP address

813
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,284
so to speak.

814
00:36:55,284 --> 00:36:57,700
So indeed, it is the case--
and we'll talk more about this

815
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,390
after lunch-- that there's a technology
called load balancing, whereby

816
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:06,060
even though my white lie earlier was
that every computer on the internet

817
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,240
has an IP address, that
doesn't necessarily

818
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,500
mean that's the IP address to
whom we speak when we send data.

819
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,850
There might be many other computers
behind a device that has that IP

820
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,580
address for purposes of balancing load.

821
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,750
But we'll come back to that again
when talking about cloud computing.

822
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,540
But not all companies do it that way.

823
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,970
If we look at Yahoo.com, Yahoo! it
would seem has three IP addresses.

824
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,221
This is a more obvious design.

825
00:37:30,221 --> 00:37:31,595
They have at least three servers.

826
00:37:31,595 --> 00:37:33,810
And frankly, they probably
have thousands of servers.

827
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:37,502
But these are the three ones they
expose publicly in terms of IPs.

828
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:39,290
And I just ran the same command again.

829
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,120
What did you notice is different?

830
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,190
The order changed.

831
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,990
And again, the order
is, again, different.

832
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:50,200
So it seems-- I'm just gleaning
this from running the command again

833
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:50,700
and again.

834
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,140
It's the same three IPs
but they're changing order.

835
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,400
It would seem that Yahoo uses round
robin load balancing-- more on this

836
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,250
in a bit-- whereby they give all
users the same three IP addresses,

837
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,750
but they change the order so
that my computer by default

838
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,380
uses just the first.

839
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,139
And this way, they put a
third of their users here,

840
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:10,430
a third of their users here,
a third of the users here.

841
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,860
Just probabilistically, based
on returning with 33% odds

842
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,870
a different one at the
top of the list each time.

843
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,370
All right.

844
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,500
So what actually happens?

845
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,590
Well, let's do this.

846
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,350
Suppose now, to make this more
clear as to what's going on here,

847
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,141
the internet as you may have heard
is filled with pictures of cats.

848
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:28,480
So suppose that one of you
in back, let's say Sean,

849
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,670
has requested a picture of a cat.

850
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,460
And I am the server, imgur.com
or Flickr or whatever.

851
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,610
And I am going to send
in this picture of a cat.

852
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,010
Unfortunately, it's
a pretty big picture.

853
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,010
It's a couple megabytes.

854
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,280
And that's not great for
everyone else in the room you

855
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,330
might want to be sending data to
each other or to Sean or from Sean

856
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,360
at the same time.

857
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,720
And so it turns out that what
IP does-- which doesn't just

858
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,870
describe IP addresses.

859
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,620
IP stands for itself, internet protocol.

860
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,610
And it works in conjunction
with another protocol called

861
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,040
TCP, transmission control protocol.

862
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,400
These are essentially conventions that
govern how the data gets from point A

863
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,270
to point B.

864
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:08,390
And a way to think of a protocol
is if I can come over here--

865
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,560
what's a human protocol?

866
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,260
Hello, my name is David.

867
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:11,840
[? Shavan ?]?

868
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,430
So this is a protocol, right?

869
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,720
Like I say hello, I extend my hand.
[? Shavan ?] knew sort of intuitively

870
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,340
to extend his hand, if awkwardly, to
stick my hand in the middle of class.

871
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,720
And then our transaction was complete.

872
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,650
Similarly does IP and CCP
govern just how computers speak.

873
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:33,600
They follow an initial kind of
hello, a subsequent kind of goodbye.

874
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,440
And it's just sort of preprogrammed
conventions that they adhere to.

875
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,550
And one of the features, meanwhile,
of these protocols, IP in particular,

876
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,320
is the ability to fragment things.

877
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,720
Because now, even
though in the real world

878
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,460
I've kind of ruined this
picture, in the digital world

879
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,332
I've just broken it up into four chunks.

880
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:51,540
A quarter of the bits are
here, a quarter of the bits

881
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,400
are here, quarter here, quarter here.

882
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,180
And now, I can put each of these
chunks in its own virtual envelope.

883
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:04,080
Which depending on the context you might
call a packet typically, or datagram,

884
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,730
or segment, which have minor
differences semantically.

885
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,200
But it just means that some
kind of virtual envelope

886
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,060
that zeros and ones go in.

887
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,150
And then I have to make sure,
of course, to address these.

888
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:23,710
So I'm going to go ahead and say that
Sean's IP address will be the number 1.

889
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,210
1.

890
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,030


891
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,300
1.

892
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,640
So I'm just writing To: 1, To: 1.

893
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,640
So every envelope now has this
on it, if Sean was the first one

894
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,100
to get an IP address in the room.

895
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,000
But I need a little
more information in case

896
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,044
he wants to acknowledge receipt of
this cat-- which is what information?

897
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:44,960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

898
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,567
DAVID J. MALAN: The from address.

899
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:48,400
So I'll be the second
computer in the world.

900
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:57,830
So I'm going to put From: 2,
From: 2, From: 2, and From: 2.

901
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:02,830
And then lastly, you might have
noticed this, I held this up.

902
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:08,420
What had I also written on the
envelope sort of preemptively.

903
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,330
Yeah, the order, the number.

904
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,300
So 1/4, 2/4, 3/4.

905
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,630
Why did I do that?

906
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

907
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,580
DAVID J. MALAN: So he knows
how to put them back together.

908
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,650
One, two, three, four.

909
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,410
And also, I had a denominator
there for a reason.

910
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:25,490
So that he knows what?

911
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,300
When to stop.

912
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,585
It's not just that it's an infinite
string of pieces of cats like a puzzle

913
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:31,210
where you don't know where the edge is.

914
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,840
Now he knows where the edges.

915
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,940
And now much like we saw with some
of the data, that the data took

916
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,080
variable length paths,
which might have meant

917
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,550
taking different routes some times.

918
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,530
And much like there's multiple
interconnections, all of this data

919
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,654
is going to leave my hands
through the same router.

920
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:48,070
[? Shavan ?] is my default router.

921
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,050
But now if you could
presumptuously pass them,

922
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,030
but not necessarily the
same direction, the effect

923
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,540
here is to have a room full
of routers, each of whom

924
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,890
roughly knows where Sean is.

925
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,280
But is making perhaps
independent decisions.

926
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,872
Routing around blockages.

927
00:42:02,872 --> 00:42:04,580
If some classmate's
not paying attention,

928
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,163
that might be the router is congested.

929
00:42:06,163 --> 00:42:08,450
And so you pass it to
someone else instead.

930
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:11,130
Two of the packets have
gotten there quite quickly.

931
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:15,040
One is kind of stuck all over here.

932
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,510
And let me if I can steal this one
as though something went wrong.

933
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:24,720


934
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,675
And if, Sean, you'd like to reassemble
the cat and draw some conclusion.

935
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:41,724


936
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:44,150
Unfortunately, there's a problem.

937
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,092
I deliberately dropped or
let a packet be dropped.

938
00:42:48,092 --> 00:42:48,800
And that happens.

939
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,970
I mean, much like the physical
this happening, routers will

940
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,962
by design drop packets.

941
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,420
Especially if they were overloaded.

942
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,410
Now I was sort of maliciously--
I took it away from David here.

943
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,117
But just as soon, I still
dropped it on the floor.

944
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:02,450
So what's your conclusion, Sean?

945
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,702
What are you missing?

946
00:43:03,702 --> 00:43:06,699
AUDIENCE: I'm missing the
bottom right half. [INAUDIBLE].

947
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:07,490
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

948
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,574
So it's corrupted or lost.

949
00:43:08,574 --> 00:43:11,698
So it was probably, if I numbered them
right, four out of four or something

950
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:12,230
like that.

951
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,960
And so TCP is this protocol that
works in conjunction with IP.

952
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,240
Whereas IP is responsible for just
fragmenting things ultimately for size

953
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,862
and also addressing things, TCP, among
its features, is to guarantee delivery.

954
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:30,320
And it does it by way of
something called sequence numbers,

955
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,700
like my one, two, three,
four, and so forth.

956
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,450
It doesn't quite do it in the same way.

957
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:37,270
But it is a numbering scheme
from which Sean and people like

958
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:40,050
him can infer what packet is missing.

959
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,700
He is going to now send a response
back that he was missing for.

960
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,490
And TCP is a protocol that
allows me to, uh-oh, let me

961
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,600
go ahead and resend
him-- not everything,

962
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,310
because that could just lead
to the same cyclical problem--

963
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,110
but let me just send
him the missing piece.

964
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:57,031
And hopefully, with high probability,
it will get through this time.

965
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:00,280
Now, even though I've lost the piece of
the cat, we're talking zeros and ones.

966
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,570
So at the end of the day,
it's just duplicating data.

967
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,790
So there's infinite supply
of copies I can make.

968
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:08,700
And so hopefully this will
now get to Sean as well.

969
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,820
But this seems a given.

970
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,260
Like why is that a feature to
guarantee delivery on the internet?

971
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,850
Well, it turns out there is another
protocol that's sometimes used

972
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:21,360
called UDP, universal datagram protocol.

973
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,690
Did I remember my acronym right?

974
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:32,280
User datagram protocol, which
does not guarantee delivery.

975
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,490
Why in the world might
you want to use IP and UDP

976
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:41,930
when implementing some application
for your business or for fun?

977
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:47,127
As opposed to TCP IP, which
is the more commonly paired.

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

979
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,456

982
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:53,450
DAVID J. MALAN: Good.

983
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:54,800
It's one fewer decision to make.

984
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,690
So if Sean doesn't even have to
think about what's missing, great.

985
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,560
Less work.

986
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,930
Less communicating with me.

987
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,380
Less resending by me.

988
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,760
That surely must take less time.

989
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,410
Good.

990
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,010
That--

991
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:05,860
AUDIENCE: Anonymity?

992
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,733

994
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,603
DAVID J. MALAN: Anonymity.

995
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:10,740
Oh, so that's an interesting one.

996
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:17,360
A key ingredient or assumption of
Sean's ability to re-request packets

997
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,290
is that he has to know
from where it came.

998
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,100
Now in this case, it's
not quite applicable

999
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,420
because he presumably
asked me for the CAD.

1000
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,810
So we already showed his
hand as to who he is.

1001
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,600
But that would be true
in other scenarios

1002
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,270
where you might want to send
information, maybe maliciously,

1003
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,860
like spam or whatever without
it being traced back to you.

1004
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,320
You don't want to resend.

1005
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,446
If the recipient doesn't
get your spam, eh, so be it.

00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:43,940
DAVID J. MALAN: It could be.

1009
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,100
But any of these could be peer to peer.

1010
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,010
Just depends on how you use them.

1011
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:49,790
Yeah, Sean?

DAVID J. MALAN: The sender doesn't--
and why might I not want a response?

1014
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,390
AUDIENCE: Because it's
[INAUDIBLE] so many devices

1015
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:00,869
out there, and [INAUDIBLE].

1016
00:46:00,869 --> 00:46:01,910
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, good.

1017
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:06,520
I mean if Sean had to acknowledge each
of the packets, that seems expensive.

1018
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,700
It's doubling the amount
of traffic coming to me,

1019
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,140
so that might be undesirable.

1020
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,520
And what kinds of
applications would actually

1021
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:18,570
be a feature not to waste time
retransmitting data if it's lost?

1022
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:22,352
Instead just blowing ahead
and forgetting about it.

1023
00:46:22,352 --> 00:46:23,560
AUDIENCE: Video transmission?

1024
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,052
DAVID J. MALAN: Video, why video.

1025
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:28,929
AUDIENCE: Like if you're
Netflix gives out [INAUDIBLE]

1026
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:30,470
back and watch what's already passed.

1027
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,450
You just want to pick up and go.

1028
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:32,440
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, good.

1029
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,939
Although I would push back slightly.

1030
00:46:33,939 --> 00:46:36,490
I feel like Netflix users would
be annoyed if they're just

1031
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,150
skipping parts of the show or movie.

1032
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:42,730
But I can-- I would propose
tweaking your answer

1033
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,268
to be a specialized use of video.

1034
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:49,172
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]-- I was
going to say, if it gets pixel-y,

1035
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:50,640
I don't want to rewatch them.

1036
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,626
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, that's fair.

1037
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:54,000
AUDIENCE: I just want to move on.

1038
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,010
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, so that's fair.

1039
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,009
But that would be, I
think, a different feature.

1040
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:58,810
More quality of service.

1041
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,150
Netflix and other companies, YouTube
have decided that users probably

1042
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,560
would rather the screen
suddenly get pixillated,

1043
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,821
but the audio still go through and
the video still be discernible.

1044
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:09,570
Even if it's not as
good of an experience.

1045
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:13,004
As opposed to buffering,
buffering, which is annoying.

1046
00:47:13,004 --> 00:47:14,920
But when might you-- but
it would be annoying,

1047
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,880
I think, if all of a sudden
at the end of the reveal.

1048
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,671
Like Sherlock is about
to discover the case

1049
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:21,590
and you just skip it
because you lost those bits.

1050
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:22,689
Minorly annoying.

1051
00:47:22,689 --> 00:47:23,980
But when is that less annoying?

1052
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,320
What types of video?

1053
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,160
AUDIENCE: Live stream [INAUDIBLE]?

1054
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,890
DAVID J. MALAN: Live.

1055
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:27,430
Yeah.

1056
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,820
So like baseball games,
sporting events, concerts.

1057
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,340
Anything where the user, just
by nature of the experience,

1058
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,390
would probably prefer
to be in real time,

1059
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:41,891
even if it means an inferior experience
than having a great experience that's

1060
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:42,390
buffered.

1061
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:45,050
Especially if you're-- it's a little
awkward if you and your friends are

1062
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,966
sort of rooting for your team to win
when your team won 10 minutes ago

1063
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,310
because of buffering.

1064
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,120
It kind of takes you out of reality.

1065
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,960
So there might be a conscious decisions.

1066
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,600
And not even just video-- not
video for like sports and events.

1067
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,710
But what about video conferencing?

1068
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,210
Right?

1069
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,870
Then it's really problematic
if you're talking to someone,

1070
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:04,430
but their remarks were uttered
seconds or minutes ago.

1071
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,940
Really you want to just kind of blow
through it and rely on the humans

1072
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:11,400
to retransmit their own voice
again, as opposed to resending

1073
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,810
the bits that might have gotten lost.

1074
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:15,310
All right.

1075
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,300
So if we have these
ingredients, where the heck

1076
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,940
did all this information come from?

1077
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,090
Like all of you this morning, if you'd
never used Harvard's network before,

1078
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,120
opened your laptop.

1079
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,490
Went to Harvard University or Harvard
guest or whatnot, typed in a password.

1080
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:31,140
But none of you typed in a DNS address,
none of you typed in a router address,

1081
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:33,110
none of you certainly
typed in a subnet mask

1082
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,151
or any of the things we've
been assuming we have.

1083
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:36,430
So where does that come from?

1084
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,650
Well it turns out there is
one other protocol that's

1085
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,250
super popular and helpful
these days called DHCP.

1086
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,420
And you might have
glimpsed this on my screen.

1087
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,570
How is my Mac configured for IPv4?

1088
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:49,500
Apparently using DHCP.

1089
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,140
And this just means it's a protocol,
dynamic host configuration protocol,

1090
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,060
that all Macs and PCs speak these days.

1091
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,275
And its purpose in life is
to automatically configure

1092
00:48:59,275 --> 00:49:00,360
your Mac and PC.

1093
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,860
Some of you might have had
internet service years ago

1094
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,957
where the technician would come out.

1095
00:49:04,957 --> 00:49:06,540
He or she would have a sheet of paper.

1096
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,640
And he or she or you would
have to manually type

1097
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,194
in your IP address, your router
address, your subnet mask.

1098
00:49:11,194 --> 00:49:13,360
Even if you don't remember
it all these years later.

1099
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,180
That was before there was DHCP.

1100
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:19,000
Or at least supported by
the ISP and your computer.

1101
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,219
But with DHCP, you open up your
laptop, you choose the Wi-Fi network.

1102
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:25,260
And your computer essentially
says the equivalent

1103
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,670
of hello, what IP address
should I use, what DNS server

1104
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,340
should I use, what router should I use?

1105
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,110
And Harvard, somewhere on
campus, has a DHCP server that

1106
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,102
just responds with that information.

1107
00:49:36,102 --> 00:49:37,310
How does it know what to use?

1108
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:42,690
Well, it turns out that Macs and PCs
have, confusingly, a MAC address.

1109
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,160
Which does not mean Macintosh,
it means media access control.

1110
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,390
Which is this hexadecimal address, where
hexadecimal is a 16-digit alphabet.

1111
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,110
Binary is two, 0 and 1.

1112
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:55,790
Decimal is 10, 0-9.

1113
00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:01,826
Hexadecimal is 0-F, where you count
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9--

1114
00:50:01,826 --> 00:50:03,450
can't say 10 because that's two digits.

1115
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:09,320
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
a, b, c, d, e, f is the convention.

1116
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,390
So this is hexadecimal.

1117
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:14,310
But that's just a really big number
expressed with some letters and digits.

1118
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:18,170
That is how Harvard
knows that you are you.

1119
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:20,970
So even if you're cleverly,
like while here for the weekend

1120
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:25,022
or here on campus in general, sort of
using incognito mode or private mode

1121
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,730
in your browser,
thinking, ooh, I'm being

1122
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:30,910
all incognito, like Harvard knows
who you are the entirety of the time.

1123
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,840
Because if you registered your
computer on Harvard's network, one

1124
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,840
of the pieces of information they
glean, besides your name and email

1125
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,670
or password or whatever, is
your computer's MAC address.

1126
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,050
Otherwise known as a hardware
address or ethernet address.

1127
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:46,230
That is ultimately tied to you.

1128
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:50,700
So there really is no anonymity on a
place like campus or in a business.

1129
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,130
Because even that lowest
level detail is there.

1130
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,380
And even though we haven't
discussed the MAC address,

1131
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,840
it turns out we've
been over-simplifying.

1132
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,510
Inside of each of these envelopes, much
like those old school Russian dolls,

1133
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:02,840
there isn't just a cat.

1134
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,680
The cat is actually
inside this envelope.

1135
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,900
And this envelope is
inside this envelope.

1136
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,260
And each of those envelopes has
slightly different information.

1137
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,410
The outermost one might have
the IP address, to and from.

1138
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,810
But the innermost one
might have a MAC address,

1139
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:21,290
depending on where it is in the story.

1140
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,090
Yeah, Avi.

1141
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:25,180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

1142
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,940
DAVID J. MALAN: An IP address
is used to get your data

1143
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:31,900
from one point to another
on a WAN, wide area network,

1144
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,110
or for all intents and
purposes, the internet.

1145
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:37,970
A MAC address is used to route
your data on a local network.

1146
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:42,470
So in this room or in this
building, behind a router.

1147
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,130
As soon as you involve
a router, you need IP.

1148
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,290
If you don't have a router or need a
router, you can rely on a MAC address.

1149
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,560
And so when I alluded
to subnet mask earlier,

1150
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:55,030
it's the subnet mask that decides
should I address this packet using

1151
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,310
the recipient's MAC address?

1152
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:59,160
Or the router's MAC address?

1153
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,310
Inside or outside?

1154
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,320
Internal or external?

1155
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:02,904
AUDIENCE: DNS?

1156
00:52:02,904 --> 00:52:03,903
DAVID J. MALAN: Felicia.

1157
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:04,403
I'm sorry?

1158
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:04,986
AUDIENCE: DNS?

1159
00:52:04,986 --> 00:52:06,750
DAVID J. MALAN: DNS
is domain name system.

1160
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:12,190
That's the device that translates
IP addresses to host names and back.

1161
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:15,760
So that is why I, the human, can
type Google.com and hit Enter.

1162
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,139
My computer is going to quickly and
transparently ask the local DNS server,

1163
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:21,680
what's the IP address for Google.com?

1164
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,400
OK.

1165
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,770
Let me write that on the
envelope instead of the words.

1166
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:27,960
Because routers understand IP
addresses, not domain names.

1167
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,870
David?

1168
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:42,362
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
to your MAC address?

1169
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:43,820
DAVID J. MALAN: They would not, no.

1170
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:47,040
So the outside world
does not see-- let me

1171
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,840
make sure I'm not misspeaking--
they do not see MAC addresses.

1172
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,790
Because the Mac address gets rewritten.

1173
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:56,160
With every hop, it would be used
from router to router, for instance.

1174
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,280
But the recipient would not see it.

1175
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,640
And so I misspoke when I said--
when I was describing the envelope

1176
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,560
inside of an envelope, it isn't
necessarily your MAC address

1177
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,870
that's in there the whole time.

1178
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:10,300
It's actually the MAC
address of the next hop.

1179
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,200
The next router, router, router.

1180
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,700
Yes.

1181
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:32,390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] right? [INAUDIBLE]
somewhere [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE]

1182
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:35,642
probably they are doing it because
[INAUDIBLE] anonymous, right?

1183
00:53:35,642 --> 00:53:36,850
You don't have to [INAUDIBLE]

1184
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:41,340


1185
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,970
DAVID J. MALAN: It's a good q-- the
MAC address typically wouldn't-- you

1186
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:48,400
wouldn't get caught by
way of your MAC address.

1187
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,490
Unless the police or the Harvard
people, the security people,

1188
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:57,900
were monitoring the local network
looking for your laptop to appear.

1189
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:05,246
So for instance, let's see, if the
FBI or whoever, NSA, were-- and let's

1190
00:54:05,246 --> 00:54:07,120
just suppose they are
these days-- monitoring

1191
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,680
all the traffic in this
room, they would see inside

1192
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,680
of my virtual envelopes, my MAC address.

1193
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,710
And so if they know from Harvard
that David has this MAC address,

1194
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,195
then the whole world-- then rather--
we-- actually it occurs to me,

1195
00:54:21,195 --> 00:54:24,070
this is David's MAC address apparently
I'm showing on the whole world

1196
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:29,410
here-- though it doesn't matter for
the same reasons we just discussed--

1197
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:31,950
you could identify a
user by their MAC address

1198
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,920
if you knew who owned it in advance.

1199
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,460
Harvard is figuring out your
MAC address because when

1200
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:40,940
you register it, when you first logged
in, the local network was detecting it.

1201
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,220
And associating that MAC
address with your identity.

1202
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:52,532
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] So how
do they do it? [INAUDIBLE].

1203
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:54,907
DAVID J. MALAN: How do they
get caught or not get caught?

1204
00:54:54,907 --> 00:54:58,390
AUDIENCE: How do they figure
out who is sending [? email? ?]

1205
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:03,730
DAVID J. MALAN: You know, so you
have to make a mistake along the way.

1206
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:07,170
Or you have to somehow associate
yourself with the addresses

1207
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,710
that the watchers are seeing.

1208
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:12,510
So your computer has at
least two unique addresses.

1209
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,530
Your IP address, which
is publicly routable,

1210
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,460
and your MAC address,
which is locally routable.

1211
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,660
The moment any of you registered
your computer on the Wi-Fi network

1212
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:23,390
earlier today or earlier
this year, you forever

1213
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:27,940
associated your identity with that
MAC address or that IP address.

1214
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:28,990
Now, Harvard knows that.

1215
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:31,750
So Harvard could be subpoenaed
for that information.

1216
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:36,260
Even if you're a bad guy who's
just bought a disposable iPad,

1217
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,300
the way to avoid this
is you somehow have

1218
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,690
to change your MAC
address, which is possible,

1219
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:43,950
or spoof your IP address to match
that of someone else who is already

1220
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:44,750
registered.

1221
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,370
That is absolutely already possible.

1222
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:50,440
But barring that, even if you do
that, all the bad guy has to do

1223
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,510
is mess up just once.

1224
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:55,140
If he or she visit some
website that is not encrypted--

1225
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,850
that is the information's
not scrambled--

1226
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,300
and they just log into their
email account or some service

1227
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:03,120
once, if the NSA has been
logging all of that traffic,

1228
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,920
they can just go back through
weeks or years worth of data.

1229
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,650
And all you have to do is to have
screwed up once in order for them

1230
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:13,696
to then rewind history and say oh, if
this was David at this point in time,

1231
00:56:13,696 --> 00:56:15,570
it must have been David
with high probability

1232
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,062
in all previous points in time.

1233
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:20,270
And that's the danger of something like
what the NSA was doing for some time.

1234
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:21,790
They're not just looking
at moments in time.

1235
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:24,580
If they're storing information
for a ridiculous amount of time,

1236
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,920
all you have to do is
reveal yourself once.

1237
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,130
And you can reconstruct
that entire history.

1238
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:33,430
And that's what's especially frightening
about the storage of so much data.

1239
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,060


1240
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,850
So in short, it's really hard.

1241
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,420
You have to be so careful.

1242
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,400
And not just-- and
never screw up really.

1243
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,959
Or never screw up and be noticed.

1244
00:56:43,959 --> 00:56:46,000
And in fact, there's-- I
forget what the case is.

1245
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,580
I just read the other
night and might pull it up

1246
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,164
for tomorrow's discussion of security.

1247
00:56:49,164 --> 00:56:51,913
There was a case where the bad
guys thought they were being clever

1248
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:53,230
by not actually sending emails.

1249
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,710
They were logging into
some shared email account.

1250
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:58,962
They would compose a
draft email, not send it.

1251
00:56:58,962 --> 00:57:01,420
But then the other bad guy
would log into the same account,

1252
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,019
look at the drafts email.

1253
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,060
Because they were thinking presumably
it's not going out on the internet.

1254
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:10,490
Which did narrow the scope of the
threat to their malicious behavior.

1255
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:13,990
But even then, the server, whoever
it was, Yahoo or Facebook or whoever,

1256
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:17,200
was surely logging who was
accessing that shared account.

1257
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,890
So with corporate cooperation can
you reveal what's going on as well.

1258
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:29,103
AUDIENCE: So maybe my next
question is so where [INAUDIBLE]

1259
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:39,470
And how do they control [INAUDIBLE]
So where-- how do they control that?

1260
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:41,845
And my last question is [INAUDIBLE].

1261
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:46,595
But it would be [INAUDIBLE]
on the internet.

1262
00:57:46,595 --> 00:57:47,150
Right?

1263
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:51,378
So if you've changed IP addresses to
your numbers, how is that being done?

1264
00:57:51,378 --> 00:57:52,634
Is there--

1265
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:55,300
DAVID J. MALAN: There is an
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority,

1266
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,740
which is a nonprofit entity
that's responsible for allocating

1267
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,460
IP addresses throughout the world.

1268
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:04,560
They typically sell or rent IP addresses
to bigger fish like internet service

1269
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,060
providers.

1270
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:08,170
Who in turn rent them effectively
to little people like us.

1271
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:11,704
Our home or our smaller business
or smaller school or the like.

1272
00:58:11,704 --> 00:58:13,870
So there's a hierarchical
system for allocating them

1273
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:17,590
in a way that ensures that
the same IP address is not

1274
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,020
rented to multiple people.

1275
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,320
In terms of where you sniff
traffic, you can certainly

1276
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,780
sniff it in any of these points.

1277
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,905
And that's what's so
frightening about sending data

1278
00:58:24,905 --> 00:58:27,910
on the internet from point A to
point B, were B is who knows where.

1279
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:31,830
Because anyone with physical access
to any of these wires or any of these

1280
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:34,780
physical machines could absolutely
be snooping on all of our data.

1281
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,060
Our best defense is disinterest.

1282
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,252
If no one really cares what we're
doing, that sort of our best protection.

1283
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:44,210
But if you do have a threat or someone
is just fishing for information,

1284
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:47,570
whether it's a government or a
company or a hacker or the like,

1285
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:50,800
they can look at all of the unencrypted
traffic inside of this network.

1286
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,240
Which is a lot of
unencrypted traffic today.

1287
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,370
In terms of companies or
countries, they would typically,

1288
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,980
especially in certain Asian countries
or Middle Eastern countries where

1289
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:03,350
there are very tight restrictions
these days on internet connectivity,

1290
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:07,240
they will generally have relatively
few-- or in the extreme case, only one

1291
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:12,130
router that routes data from inside
the country to outside the country.

1292
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,750
And so the great firewall
of China or restrictions

1293
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,520
in Pakistan or other
countries might just

1294
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,520
have relatively few devices that
are imposing those firewall rules,

1295
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,748
preventing Facebook traffic from
coming in or going out, for instance.

1296
00:59:24,748 --> 00:59:31,824
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] So how do
they control them? [INAUDIBLE]

1297
00:59:31,824 --> 00:59:32,990
DAVID J. MALAN: It's harder.

1298
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:36,570
I mean, if you are
running-- well, if you've

1299
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:40,690
built your own Facebook knockoff,
you have one or more IP addresses

1300
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:41,610
associated with it.

1301
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,880
So even if you're running those
within the boundaries of the country,

1302
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,180
if you only have a finite
number of IP addresses,

1303
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:51,100
the country could, if
they control DNS, simply

1304
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,950
prevent resolution for
like ourFacebook.com

1305
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:58,730
from actually being
converted to IP addresses.

1306
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:01,940
So there are sort of choke points
that you could exercise control over.

1307
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:05,322
Whether it's at the packet level
or at the system level like this.

1308
01:00:05,322 --> 01:00:08,280
In fact, there was a mistake at one
point where some country or company

1309
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,196
accidentally brought
down much of the internet

1310
01:00:10,196 --> 01:00:12,210
abroad for a brief amount of time.

1311
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,380
Just because of a
misconfiguration of DNS.

1312
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,340
And because so many
people are reliant on DNS.

1313
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,470
If this starts returning
bogus information or just

1314
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,980
incorrect information, it
has this cascading effect

1315
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,274
of breaking most anything.

1316
01:00:23,274 --> 01:00:24,690
So there's lots of different ways.

1317
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:27,770
I mean, mostly what's happening
in recent years and months

1318
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:30,600
with all these revelations is
people are just realizing how

1319
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,507
insecure the network has always been.

1320
01:00:33,507 --> 01:00:34,590
These are not new threats.

1321
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:37,920
These are just threats that
are being more publicized.

1322
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,910
But lots more scary
stories tomorrow, as well.

1323
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:41,510
All right.

1324
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,510
So where did this come from?

1325
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,490
DHCP.

1326
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:47,390
So dynamic host configuration protocol.

1327
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:51,550
So that's just something that our Mac
or PC is pre-configured to know about.

1328
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:56,050
So what is that actually
let us do ultimately?

1329
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,650
Is actually use the internet
without actually having

1330
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:01,530
to manually configure our machine.

1331
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:02,200
All right.

1332
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,600
So let's toss a couple of
more items into alphabet soup.

1333
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,680
Which is actually germane
to exactly that chat.

1334
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,096
And some of you might use this
at work, even if you're not

1335
01:01:11,096 --> 01:01:13,450
quite sure what it's doing for you.

1336
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:16,010
Who here uses a VPN for work?

1337
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:16,510
OK.

1338
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:19,400
So about a quarter of the folks here.

1339
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,440
Why do you use it?

1340
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,310
Or what does it do for you?

1341
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:25,526
Grace?

1342
01:01:25,526 --> 01:01:28,222
AUDIENCE: Just to access
any of our secure data

1343
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:31,576
or certain websites or
tools [INAUDIBLE] VPN.

1344
01:01:31,576 --> 01:01:34,700
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, to access certain
websites or tools within the company.

1345
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,315
[? Avi ?]?

1346
01:01:35,315 --> 01:01:36,190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1347
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:39,782


1348
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:41,990
DAVID J. MALAN: To remotely
access the local network,

1349
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,460
back home or at your company.

1350
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:46,347
Anyone else have disparate use cases?

1351
01:01:46,347 --> 01:01:47,680
This is generally the principle.

1352
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,130
VPN is virtual private network.

1353
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:53,090
And it allows you to by
running some software,

1354
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:56,880
usually logging in with the username and
password that maybe get preconfigured,

1355
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,340
to create the illusion that your
computer is not on Harvard's network,

1356
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,650
for instance, but on your
own company's network.

1357
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:03,150
And

1358
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:05,860
So you will suddenly
have an IP address that

1359
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,650
appears to be not only--
you have two IP addresses.

1360
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:12,000
One that's at Harvard, and
often one is that your company

1361
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,990
or at your home, wherever the
end point is for that VPN.

1362
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:17,860
The upside of that is that
if your company or your home

1363
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:21,700
or your campus' system administrators
have decided this financial software

1364
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,210
or whatever is just too
sensitive to be on the internet,

1365
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:27,160
we want people to be physically
or virtually on our network,

1366
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,590
they can restrict access to that
piece of software or website

1367
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:34,940
or whatever to only those people
who are on the network physically,

1368
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,380
or virtually, as via VPN
in the latter scenario.

1369
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:42,560
The upside of this is that you
have a secure connection encrypted.

1370
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,920
All of the traffic to in
Grace's laptop, wherever

1371
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,260
she is in the world and
her company, are encrypted.

1372
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,990
So that even if a bad guy
sees zeros and ones flying by,

1373
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,210
they're seemingly random.

1374
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:56,400
And they're not information that
they could glean much detail from.

1375
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,750
The VPN has another application.

1376
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:04,680
Why do some people abroad in the
countries like we've been describing

1377
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,330
or the scenarios use VPN?

1378
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,149
What problem might it also solve?

1379
01:03:08,149 --> 01:03:10,482
AUDIENCE: For instance, China
where Facebook is blocked,

1380
01:03:10,482 --> 01:03:12,035
people use VPN to access Facebook.

1381
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:12,910
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.

1382
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,780
It's surprising how
many Harvard undergrads

1383
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:17,500
seem to visit China and
posts on Facebook while

1384
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,770
in China, which is blocked.

1385
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:23,540
But the reality is that if you have
enough technical savvy and enough

1386
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,560
access technologically, you could, in
theory, in China or any other country

1387
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,980
use your laptop to establish a VPN
connection, a virtual private network

1388
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:34,330
connection, to a place like
Harvard or your company.

1389
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:36,310
Or you can even pay
third parties these days

1390
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:38,560
to have a VPN connection
in any number of countries

1391
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,440
to really bounce yourself
around the world.

1392
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,530
And what happens then is that
China or whatever the country is

1393
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,880
would know that you have an
internet connection between you

1394
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,030
and the outside world.

1395
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,800
But by nature of it being
encrypted, they can't see inside.

1396
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:57,510
And so they therefore either by
conscious choice or disinterest

1397
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:01,320
or oversight, allow you to
maintain that connection.

1398
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,600
But the result is that all
of your Facebook traffic

1399
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,630
doesn't go directly from you in
that country to Facebook.com.

1400
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:11,430
It first goes through America or
wherever your VPN server actually

1401
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,019
is or company actually is.

1402
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:14,060
Then it goes to Facebook.

1403
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:15,710
Then it goes back to your company.

1404
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:17,220
Then it goes to you.

1405
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,620
So just intuitively, what's
the downside of this approach

1406
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,790
to circumventing those
kinds of protections?

1407
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:23,964
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1408
01:04:23,964 --> 01:04:26,630
DAVID J. MALAN: It's got to be
slower if you're adding distance.

1409
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,314
And frankly, you're adding cryptography.

1410
01:04:28,314 --> 01:04:29,230
More on that tomorrow.

1411
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:31,180
You're adding the
scrambling of information

1412
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,800
which takes a non-zero amount of time.

1413
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,950
Might slow things down.

1414
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:36,130
But the upside, of course,
is that you can access,

1415
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,040
theoretically, protected resources.

1416
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,020
Now, there is no reason
the country or the company

1417
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,940
couldn't prevent VPN connections,
or prevent VPN connections

1418
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,920
to known places like Harvard.edu.

1419
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,620
But assuming the cryptography,
the scrambling information

1420
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:54,810
is correct and secure, they
at least can't see what's

1421
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:57,170
inside of it if they do allow it.

1422
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:59,960
So these are the kinds of trade-offs.

1423
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,660
But VPN services seems to be
very much in vogue these days.

1424
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:08,590
And people do not so much
for issues of-- well, still

1425
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:09,800
for issues of circumvention.

1426
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,540
VPNs are very popular among Netflix
subscribers and Hulu subscribers.

1427
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,445
Why?

1428
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:18,661
AUDIENCE: Access location
specific streams?

1429
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:20,660
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah,
location specific streams.

1430
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:23,687
So like certain shows only
air in the UK initially.

1431
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:26,770
And so you might want-- like Downtown
Abbey, if you were really into that,

1432
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:30,760
and you want to get access before PBS in
the US has it, you can VPN into the UK

1433
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:36,020
and watch it on whatever the network--
the BBC's channels there, perhaps.

1434
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:39,020
Netflix was in the press recently
because they've been clamping down

1435
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,090
on their own customers' use of VPNs.

1436
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:44,840
Because if you're traveling abroad--
even if you're a legitimate Netflix

1437
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,741
subscriber but you travel abroad,
and you go to Netflix.com,

1438
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:49,990
log in with your American
account, you might still not

1439
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:51,740
be able to access the resources.

1440
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,680
Because of whatever partner
or licensing arrangements

1441
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,416
they've made with the big
film studios and TV studios,

1442
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:58,790
they just won't stream it to you.

1443
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:03,390
Unless you pretend to be in America,
as you could with a VPN service.

1444
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:06,630
But there are certain VPN services that
have gotten super popular, it seems.

1445
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:09,460
So Netflix simply blacklists
their IP addresses.

1446
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,040
So that even that doesn't work.

1447
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:12,775
Yeah?

1448
01:06:12,775 --> 01:06:13,650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1449
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:16,585


1450
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:17,460
DAVID J. MALAN: Sure.

1451
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,480
So Tor is an interesting thing.

1452
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,380
This is the-- Tor Onion
Router, so to speak,

1453
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:25,190
which is an anonymous technology.

1454
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:30,210
This essentially allows you
and your laptop or desktop

1455
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:34,244
to create essentially a
multi-hub VPN connection.

1456
01:06:34,244 --> 01:06:37,160
Where you connect to someone else,
he or she connects to someone else,

1457
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,510
he or she connects to someone else.

1458
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:40,468
So you have these several
layers of indirection

1459
01:06:40,468 --> 01:06:41,820
that aren't at the router level.

1460
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:46,020
They're just at individual
laptops or desktops.

1461
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:49,840
But the result is that you have
plausible deniability in some way.

1462
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:54,860
Whereby if you are requesting some
websites that's way over here,

1463
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:57,154
but your traffic appears
to, not unlike the movies

1464
01:06:57,154 --> 01:07:00,320
have come from here to here to here to
here to here to here to here to here,

1465
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,270
the resulting website isn't
going to know who you are.

1466
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,880
They're going to know you
only as whoever the most

1467
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,750
recent hop in that network was.

1468
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:12,110
So that might seem to put them at a
disadvantage and you at an advantage.

1469
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:14,870
But insofar as you're participating
in this anonymization network,

1470
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:19,160
the same might be true when that person
wants to access something anonymously

1471
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,430
that your request might appear
to be coming from your laptop.

1472
01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:26,640
The catch, though, is that certainly
if all of the middlemen in the story

1473
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,000
reveal their logs.

1474
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,730
Like everyone in the story knows
to whom they've been connecting

1475
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:32,290
and to whom they're connecting.

1476
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:35,225
So you're really just making it
harder for like subpoenas to chip

1477
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:36,100
away at this problem.

1478
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,970
You'd have to subpoena this
machine, this machine, this machine,

1479
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:38,650
this machine.

1480
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,608
And if they're well
configured technologically,

1481
01:07:40,608 --> 01:07:43,560
they won't remember any of this
information by design anyway.

1482
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,590
But it's not foolproof.

1483
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:47,690
In fact, a few years ago
there was a bomb scare

1484
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:51,660
at Harvard during, coincidentally, exam
period, which was actually traced back

1485
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,730
to a student, I believe.

1486
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,810
Even though he-- and this is
all publicly documented in

1487
01:07:56,810 --> 01:08:00,200
newspaper articles-- was using,
I believe, Tor at the time.

1488
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,760
The problem, though, is
that-- and I'm only inferring,

1489
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,950
I think, from the details-- if you're
the only Tor user, or one of few Tor

1490
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:09,680
users on campus when a
bomb threat is called in,

1491
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,480
you might appear to be anonymous.

1492
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:14,901
But that protocol is still identifiable.

1493
01:08:14,901 --> 01:08:16,609
So you might not know,
or the authorities

1494
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:19,520
might not know what those
few Tor users were doing.

1495
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,010
But they certainly knew who
presumably to question first.

1496
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:26,334
And so it only helps
in certain scenarios.

1497
01:08:26,334 --> 01:08:27,209
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1498
01:08:27,209 --> 01:08:31,880


1499
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,880
DAVID J. MALAN: Correct.

1500
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,500
The more, the better.

1501
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:38,240
But even then-- Google up on
it, security of Tor networks.

1502
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,109
The folks at the edges are
sometimes exposed nonetheless

1503
01:08:41,109 --> 01:08:43,100
because of issues like this.

1504
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:48,410
So it's not something to sort of build
a business or super secure communication

1505
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:49,100
on necessarily.

1506
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,441
It helps, but nothing is foolproof.

01:08:52,316 --> 01:08:55,990


1509
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,086
DAVID J. MALAN: To what?

1510
01:08:57,086 --> 01:08:57,529
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1511
01:08:57,529 --> 01:08:58,320
DAVID J. MALAN: Oh.

1512
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,399
So that's very different.

1513
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,470
I know less about that one.

1514
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,510
But let's come back to that one
tomorrow morning in more detail.

1515
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:08,550
Less we go too far into security today.

1516
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:10,439
Other questions?

1517
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:10,950
All right.

1518
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:13,420
So we have this whole
alphabet soup, all of which

1519
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,417
together actually allow
us to do something.

1520
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,500
So what is that something?

1521
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,670
What is one of the most common things?

1522
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:20,794
Let's conclude our look at internet
technologies at the one that most of us

1523
01:09:20,794 --> 01:09:23,880
are using so much these days,
which is web related stuff.

1524
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:28,569
And in fact the one acronym we haven't
mentioned yet that you sort of see

1525
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:30,630
or use all the time is http.

1526
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,710
Hyper text transfer protocol.

1527
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,250
Which is yet another sort of
handshake kind of protocol

1528
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,840
that dictates how computers
interact with servers.

1529
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,490
And what is http used for?

1530
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:42,770
Well, typically in a
browser, back in the day,

1531
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:47,540
you would type
http://www.google.com and hit Enter.

1532
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,720
Nowadays most of us
probably don't type http.

1533
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:52,189
We've sort of fallen out of that habit.

1534
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:55,800
Most of us probably don't
even type www these days.

1535
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:01,140
Why is that but none of us
seem to do that anymore?

1536
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,850
DNS is true.

1537
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:09,250
So long as Google.com has an IP
address and not just www.google.com,

1538
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,310
it will just work.

1539
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:13,960
And in fact, web servers
can forcibly redirect you.

1540
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,730
If you visit Google.com,
they can send a response

1541
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:18,200
that is not Google's home page.

1542
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,660
It's an initial response that
says no, go here instead.

1543
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:25,520
Your browser will then behind the
scenes request www.google.com,

1544
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,350
thereby filling in the blanks for you.

1545
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:30,270
Why do we humans rarely
if ever type http anymore?

1546
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:35,614


1547
01:10:35,614 --> 01:10:36,406
AUDIENCE: Protocol?

1548
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:37,613
DAVID J. MALAN: New protocol?

1549
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:38,500
Not even.

1550
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,600

1552
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:40,430
DAVID J. MALAN: What's that?

1553
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:41,430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1554
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:42,720
DAVID J. MALAN: The
browser does it for you.

1555
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:42,880
Right?

1556
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,290
If you're using a browser--
even though browsers actually

1557
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:48,160
can do a few different things,
typically, different protocols FTP,

1558
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,670
http, and a few others
sometimes-- the reality

1559
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:52,930
is 99 point whatever percent
of the time you're just

1560
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:54,800
using them for http traffic.

1561
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,590
So you want your browser to speak this
protocol, which we'll see in a moment.

1562
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,820
And so it's just inferred.

1563
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:04,140
And in fact, browsers even assume
that if you type in something dot com

1564
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:08,070
and something dot com doesn't exist,
they will often presumptuously pre-pend

1565
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:14,180
for you www.-- try that address just
in case the website's not configured

1566
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:14,870
for you.

1567
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:18,060
In fact, I still remember, it was an
amazing example for class discussions,

1568
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:22,340
years ago http://harvard.edu
did not work.

1569
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:25,950
Which was infuriating, because you'd
go to it and you'd hit a dead end.

1570
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,370
Which sort of doesn't
reflect well, I think.

1571
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:32,030
But it was an amazing opportunity to
discuss in class why it was broken.

1572
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:35,290
And then at some point,
I must-- someone new

1573
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:38,370
was hired at Harvard who similarly
thought this was ridiculous.

1574
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,880
And within days it was fixed.

1575
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,970
So unfortunately, it's
not a good story anymore.

1576
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:47,130
But it is purely by human
convention that most websites still

1577
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:48,920
start with www.

1578
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,370
And in fact, it's why you see on
advertisements something advertised

1579
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:56,880
as www.something.com, because
for a lot of users out there,

1580
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,170
technophobes some of them
or less technical people,

1581
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:01,790
it's a visual identifier
that this is a website.

1582
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:04,310
Now these days, you might argue
that do you really need it?

1583
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:07,320
Like what's another good visual
cue that when you see something

1584
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,160
you should type it into a browser.

1585
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,130
.com alone is pretty good.

1586
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:17,310
But nowadays, this is a new problem
that will start to resurge again.

1587
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:23,500
Most of us have seen .com and .edu
and probably .net and probably .org.

1588
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:27,133
But there is bunches of
others like .travel--

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1590
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:29,776
DAVID J. MALAN: Dot what?

1591
01:12:29,776 --> 01:12:32,210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1592
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:37,980
.gl, .tv, .io.

1593
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:42,990
And to make a bad problem worse, if
you go to a website now, Registrar--

1594
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:49,290
more on this in a moment-- there
are an atrocious number of generic

1595
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:52,670
TLD's as they're called-- and this
is a recent change in the past year

1596
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:58,990
or so where the world just got really
messy-- OK. .guru, .clothing, .singles,

1597
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:04,407
.holdings, .ventures, .equipment,
.plumbing, .cam-- I mean, it's just--

1598
01:13:04,407 --> 01:13:05,740
I'm embarrassed to say them all.

1599
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:10,540
They're just so innumerable now.

1600
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:14,010
So gone are the days-- now you
just have to look for a period.

1601
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:17,840
And when you see a period or a dot, like
type it into a browser it would seem.

1602
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,190
So there's kind of
this interesting issue

1603
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:26,890
now, whereby much like we benefited
with the phone numbers for years.

1604
01:13:26,890 --> 01:13:29,140
Like if you saw 800 dash
something, dash something,

1605
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,690
you just knew intuitively
it was a phone number.

1606
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:32,981
No one had to tell you to
call this number necessarily.

1607
01:13:32,981 --> 01:13:35,570
And we've had that same
tendency for first with http.

1608
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:36,860
Then we just www.

1609
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:37,489
Then with .com.

1610
01:13:37,489 --> 01:13:40,530
And now there's perhaps a regression
in so far as I know lots of people--

1611
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:42,571
and even I wouldn't
necessarily know that if they

1612
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:44,340
see something dot
something that it's not

1613
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:47,040
just some trendy way of
marketing your sort of syntax

1614
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,690
as opposed to it being
an actual domain name.

1615
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:52,300
So it'll be interesting
to see what happens now.

1616
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:58,720
But this is to say that websites
ultimately have domain names.

1617
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,416
And they're accessed by
way of this protocol, http.

1618
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:02,790
And let's see what it looks like.

1619
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:05,270
It turns out that if I go
to google.com, I of course

1620
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:07,420
see a page that looks a
little something like this.

1621
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:10,850
Most browsers have a feature
somewhere like under Chrome,

1622
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:14,640
it's under Developer, View Source, where
you can actually see the underlying

1623
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,210
code that composes the web page.

1624
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:18,760
This isn't programming code per se.

1625
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,800
This is mostly a language called
html and css, more on that

1626
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,090
later this afternoon.

1627
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:26,700
But this is the language in
which web pages are written.

1628
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:31,350
It's scary looking here because Google
has compacted it as much as possible.

1629
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:35,290
And it does a little more than a typical
website might in terms of features.

1630
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,920
But this is what was inside
the virtual envelope.

1631
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,130
So Sean got a cat.

1632
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:43,160
But when I go to google.com, I get all
of this inside of my virtual envelopes.

1633
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:49,307
And together, remarkably, all of
this implements just this simplicity.

1634
01:14:49,307 --> 01:14:52,390
But there's actually some programming
code in a language called JavaScript

1635
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:53,910
there as well.

1636
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:56,050
But notice, I can get
that same response.

1637
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:58,014
I'm going to pretend
to be a browser here.

1638
01:14:58,014 --> 01:14:59,930
I'm going to run a program
called Telnet which

1639
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:03,850
is an old school program, good for
diagnostics these days, to Google.com.

1640
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:06,030
That's the server to
which I want to connect.

1641
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:08,800
And specifically, I want
to connect to port 80.

1642
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,980
It turns out that TCP which we discussed
earlier, which guarantees delivery,

1643
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:19,340
it also, among its features assigns
numbers to different services.

1644
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:23,120
So if I summarize a
couple of these, 80 is

1645
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,790
for-- actually, we'll do it right here.

1646
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:30,945
Http has the TCP port number called 80.

1647
01:15:30,945 --> 01:15:33,070
Https, which most folks
probably know means secure,

1648
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:37,210
it's encrypted somehow-- more
on that tomorrow-- is 443.

1649
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:41,300
Email, otherwise known as
simple mail transfer protocol,

1650
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:50,980
is usually on port 25 or 487 or--
I'm getting this wrong-- 5-- 46--

1651
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,230
I can't remember offhand.

1652
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:53,630
Usually on 25.

1653
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:55,110
And two other numbers.

1654
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:57,871
400-something and 500-something.

1655
01:15:57,871 --> 01:16:00,120
But in short, I'm going to
use this Telnet program now

1656
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,730
to connect to Google
server on that port.

1657
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:06,950
So I'm not sending an email as
it might look like if I did this.

1658
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:09,090
I'm instead pretending to be a browser.

1659
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:11,670
And notice that I'm
connected to google.com.

1660
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:14,870
I can now type textually, just for
demonstration's sake, the following.

1661
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:21,466
GET / HTTP/1.1 from the
host www.google.com.

1662
01:16:21,466 --> 01:16:23,950
What I have just typed
is the digital equivalent

1663
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:26,790
of my having extended my
hand to [? Shavan ?] earlier.

1664
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,660
This is what's inside
my virtual envelope

1665
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:30,400
when I request a page from Google.

1666
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,920
When I hit Enter now, I get
back all of that messiness.

1667
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,900
Which previously we saw
in Chrome, now I just

1668
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,640
see in my little black and white window.

1669
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,590
But that's all http is.

1670
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:42,180
It has more commands
and more instructions

1671
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,390
that the server understands.

1672
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:47,020
But at its essence, all
you are saying is get me

1673
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:51,937
a specific URL with version like
1.1 of the particular protocol.

1674
01:16:51,937 --> 01:16:53,520
And that's all that's happening there.

1675
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:59,020
And if you're using https, all of
that goes and it comes back encrypted,

1676
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,410
scrambled.

1677
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:03,780
So what does that mean
at the end of the day?

1678
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:05,730
At the end of the day,
this web page still

1679
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,620
needs to get written
in another language.

1680
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,270
And we'll come back to that later.

1681
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:11,061
The other language is
going to be something

1682
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:13,730
called htmp, HyperText Markup Language.

1683
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:16,610
With something called CSS,
cascading style sheets.

1684
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:19,030
Also some JavaScript.

1685
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:20,180
More on that tomorrow.

1686
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:22,715
And if I'm ever rattling off
acronyms just super fast,

1687
01:17:22,715 --> 01:17:27,560
it's because usually that doesn't
matter what they are, but how they work

1688
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,850
or how they're relevant.

1689
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,150
And html and CSS are
the actual languages

1690
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:35,080
that implement underneath
the hood the web page.

1691
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,650
So let's answer one final question.

1692
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:39,250
Where did www.google.com come from?

1693
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:42,890
Or if you're starting a business or if
you have some personal portfolio site

1694
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:45,870
and you want to put
yourself on the internet

1695
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,180
with your own domain
name, what do you do?

1696
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:52,380
Does anyone want to offer
if you've done this before?

1697
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1698
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,508
DAVID J. MALAN: Register, OK.

1699
01:17:54,508 --> 01:17:56,900
So you go to an internet
registrar so to speak.

1700
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:57,620
Registrar.

1701
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:00,120
And there's dozens, if not
hundreds, of them these days.

1702
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:03,100
And from them you buy a domain name.

1703
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,800
Or you kind of rent the domain name.

1704
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,110
Because by nature of how
the internet was set up,

1705
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:09,800
we pay annually for these things.

1706
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:17,640
From like $5 to maybe $200 depending on
which top level domain or TLD you want.

1707
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,950
By TLD I mean .com or .org or .guru.

1708
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:23,700
In fact, if we go back
to namecheap, which

1709
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,250
is a popular, fairly
inexpensive website,

1710
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:35,970
if I want to get computerscience.guru,
search, let's see if this is available.

1711
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:39,170
It is not available,
someone already owns that.

1712
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,600
Let's see what it is.

1713
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,162


1714
01:18:43,162 --> 01:18:44,870
Nope, they're not
doing anything with it.

1715
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:47,260
Oh and notice, maybe now
even Chrome's error messages

1716
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,900
make a little more sense.

1717
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:53,090
Computer science guru server's
DNS address could not be found.

1718
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,250
So that means that my
computer tried to figure out

1719
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:58,862
the IP address of
computerscience.guru, and it

1720
01:18:58,862 --> 01:19:01,070
seems the person might have
paid for this domain name

1721
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,910
but not actually done step two.

1722
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:06,470
Which is actually an amazing
segue to what step two should be.

1723
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:10,142
Once you own the domain name,
what comes next if you've done it?

1724
01:19:10,142 --> 01:19:11,600
AUDIENCE: Link it to an IP address.

1725
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,110
DAVID J. MALAN: You have to
link it to an IP address.

1726
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:15,460
So you need some kind
of web host, which would

1727
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,390
be the generic way of describing it.

1728
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:19,200
And this is either your own server.

1729
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,130
You could in theory run your
own server, get an IP address

1730
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:23,880
or plug it into the
internet and so forth.

1731
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,421
Most people don't do that these days.

1732
01:19:25,421 --> 01:19:26,590
They'll use a cloud service.

1733
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:28,830
More on that after lunch time.

1734
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:34,040
But you'll sign up for someone
like dreamhost.com or heroku.com

1735
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,890
or Amazon Web Services or Microsoft
Azure or Google App Engine.

1736
01:19:37,890 --> 01:19:41,705
Or any number of third parties
who run servers and software

1737
01:19:41,705 --> 01:19:44,330
and give you storage space where
you can put all of your files,

1738
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:48,100
all of your web content, and they
give you an IP address, or really

1739
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,780
a shared IP address, maybe
with other sites using it.

1740
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:53,199
And you actually put your content here.

1741
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:54,990
And so there's two
steps, and both of these

1742
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:57,540
involve some kind of
financial transaction

1743
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:01,160
if you're indeed using someone
else's servers and software

1744
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,064
to run your website.

1745
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:03,480
And there's more steps in between.

1746
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:07,280
Generally, it's documented and it
completely varies by whom you partner

1747
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,160
with.

1748
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,170
But we'll see later today what it looks
like to actually write code that you

1749
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:15,220
might put on to step two servers.

1750
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,048
