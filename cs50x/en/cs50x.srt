1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,650

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,830
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Hello world, this is
CS50, Harvard University's introduction

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,260
to the intellectual
enterprises of computer science

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,620
and the art of programming for
majors and non-majors alike.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,060
Indeed, most of the students who
take CS50, both on campus and off,

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,400
have no prior experience.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,070
>> This here is Sanders Theater
at Harvard University where

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,500
we'll meet for lectures and
introduce each of the week's concept,

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,670
though, for the first time ever,
we'll travel to Yale University

10
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,010
for some lectures as well.

11
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,101
>> You also soon meet Zamyla who
leads the course's walk through,

12
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,600
wherein she'll walk you through
each of the weeks challenges

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,150
and Rob, who leads the
courses postmortems wherein

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,440
he'll reveal solutions to the same.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,980
And oh, Doug, who leads
the course's sections,

16
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,150
wherein he'll review the
week's material in more detail.

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,160
>> For the first of the course's problem
sets or programming assignments,

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,590
we'll dive into Scratch, a
graphical programming language

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,270
from MITs Media Lab, via which you
can program by dragging and dropping

20
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,400
virtual puzzle pieces
that only interlock

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,410
if it makes logical sense to do so.

22
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,740
>> We'll then transition to C, a more
traditional language with which you'll

23
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,209
build Mario's pyramid and more.

24
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,380
We'll then explore the
world of cryptography,

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,530
the art of scrambling
information, and you'll

26
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,100
write code with which to encrypt
and decrypt secret messages.

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,630
>> After that, we'll implement a game
of 15 and you'll create something

28
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,400
that you and your friends can play.

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,170
And then we'll look at forensics.

30
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,670
I'll accidentally delete
some photos and you'll

31
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,200
need to write code with
which to recover them.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,890
>> After that, perhaps our
biggest challenge in C.

33
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,690
We'll hand you a dictionary
of over 140,000 English words

34
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,600
and you'll need to create the
fastest spell checker you can.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,540
And then we'll transition
to web programming.

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,331
First, you'll implement
your own web server

37
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:41,010
in C that serves up actual web pages.

38
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,290
Then, using PHP, SQL, and more,
you'll implement a web application

39
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,780
with which to buy and sell stocks using
virtual dollars, programmatically,

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,640
using Yahoo Finance to retrieve
nearly real time prices.

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,270
>> We'll then match together
Google Maps and Google News.

42
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,030
And using JavaScript and more,
you'll build a web application

43
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,670
with which to find articles from
nearly any city in the world.

44
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,660
After all that, you'll build
something entirely of your own.

45
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,460
A final project designed
and implemented by you.

46
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,850
>> All of this and more await.

47
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,350
This is CS50.

48
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,674
