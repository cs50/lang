00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,127


2
00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:01,210
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

3
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,160
We are back.

4
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,810
So, the goal of this final session
is to introduce a few more concepts

5
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,290
but also give everyone a chance
to kind of stretch your fingers

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,270
and actually do something
a little hands-on.

7
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,897
The goal is not to turn
us all into web developers

8
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,230
by any means but really just
to give you a taste of some

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,750
of the fundamental constructs of what
goes into web programming and today web

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,980
development, so the
static side of things--

11
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,660
no logic, no programming
language, just static content.

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,660
And it will give us an opportunity
to actually see what a web server is,

13
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,140
see what an HTML file is, see what
it is HTTP is actually serving up.

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,600
But before we dive in, any retrospective
questions about cloud computing

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,922
or security or anything in between?

16
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:44,890
No?

17
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,181
All right, well, let's
do this, just in case

18
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,680
the process of signing up for
something takes a few minutes.

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,221
We'll let it do it in the background.

20
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:56,860
Go ahead, if you could,
to this URL here-- c9.io.

21
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,810
This is a third-party service--
platform as a service, if you will--

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,190
that is going to invite you
to sign up for an account,

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,650
and it's going to give each of you
an account in the so-called cloud

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,330
on someone else's infrastructure,
a company called Cloud9.

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,350
But what's nice about
this is that they give you

26
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,990
an approximation of an
actual real-world development

27
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,530
environment, albeit in the
cloud and in a web browser,

28
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,175
and we'll use this to actually
experiment a bit today.

29
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:27,116


30
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:30,260
And then go ahead and just navigate
your way to the sign-up process

31
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,630
if you could.

32
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,080
So we happen to use this in the class
I teach for all of our students,

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,140
both on campus and off now, and
it's replaced what historically

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,390
was otherwise downloadable software.

35
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,620
So what you were gaining access to
is one of these virtual machines,

36
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,460
essentially, that I described earlier.

37
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,260
So this company Cloud9 probably
rents from a third party-- indeed

38
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,760
in this case, Google-- a whole
bunch of virtual machines

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,500
that they somehow chop up into
the illusion of individual servers

40
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,610
that each of us has full control over.

41
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,640
It's not quite accurate to say
that they're virtual machines,

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,550
though, because what
Cloud9 actually uses

43
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,570
is a somewhat newer technology
called containerization.

44
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:13,150
And let me grab this picture
here to paint this picture.

45
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,540
A container is, if
you recall the picture

46
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,900
from earlier, a little lighter
weight than a virtual machine.

47
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,090
In fact, whereas last
time we talked about there

48
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,170
being an operating
system and a hypervisor

49
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,260
and then guest operating system, guest
operating system, guest operating

50
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,940
system, on top of your
physical hardware,

51
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,740
the difference with this newer
technology, containerization,

52
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,290
is that they all somehow share
the same operating system.

53
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,970
But they still create
the illusion of everyone

54
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,590
having his or her own exclusive
administrative rights and files

55
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,400
on the server.

56
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,230
But there's less software in
between you and the hardware.

57
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,260
The result of which is, in
theory, a higher performance,

58
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,470
because you're using or
wasting fewer resources

59
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,360
on that so-called virtualization layer.

60
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,420
So this is called
containerization by nature

61
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,920
by way of a technology called Docker,
which is very much coming into its own.

62
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,086
And this is something that
engineers at your company

63
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:08,610
might kind of sort of start talking
about soon if they haven't already,

64
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,590
though there's certainly no
reason to jump on any bandwagons.

65
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,410
So with that said, what
you probably see now

66
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:22,670
is a screen that looks a bit like this.

67
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,170
OK.

68
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,260
And just call me over if not.

69
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,440
And if so-- I'll come over if not.

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,244
Go ahead and click that big
plus to create a workspace,

71
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:31,660
and you'll see a screen like this.

72
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,020
You can call the workspace
name anything you want for now.

73
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,660
And just actually for simplicity,
go and-- well, some of you

74
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,660
already have workspaces.

75
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:47,050
Call it whatever you want-- business,
Harvard, Thursday, whatever you'd like.

76
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,800
You don't need a description.

77
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,380
You can leave it private, unless you
already have a bunch of workspaces.

78
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,280
If you're forced to make it public,
that's fine for today's purposes.

79
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,750
Here, too, is one of the upsells.

80
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,939
You get one private workspace by
default. But if you want more,

81
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:00,980
you have to pay for more.

82
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,870
Otherwise, they force you
to make your work public.

83
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,600
But that's fine, because they also
target this at open-source communities

84
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,700
to encourage people to
actually collaborate.

85
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,699
And the last thing that's important,
though, is, after you choose a name

86
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:17,140
and after you choose private or public,
click HTML5, the big orange icon

87
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,430
second from the left, and
then click Create Workspace.

88
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,580
And it will probably
take a minute or so,

89
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,540
but you'll then have an
environment, once you

90
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,544
do that, that looks reminiscent of
what I have on the screen here now.

91
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:33,210
But, again, it might take a minute
or more to get to this screen

92
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,770
once you've clicked Create Workspace.

93
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,936
But just flag me over if you'd like me
to take a look at anything or advise.

94
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:40,191


95
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:40,690
All right.

96
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,390
So I'm going to background this for now.

97
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,260
Call me over if you seem to
have any technical difficulties.

98
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,210
But, again, it might take a
little bit for that to open.

99
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,570
And let's go ahead and talk about what
it actually means to make a web page,

100
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,780
what HTML is, and how all of this
now interconnects as we're starting

101
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,730
to actually use some of the technology.

102
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,310
So it turns out that I can
go on my little Mac here,

103
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,650
open a simple program called
TextEdit, or on Windows I could

104
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,480
open something called Notepad.exe.

105
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,260
And I could just simply do something
like this-- "hello, world."

106
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,020
And then I could save this as
hello.txt So no magic there.

107
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,200
This has nothing to do with web
programming, nothing to do with HTML.

108
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,790
Just creating a simple text file.

109
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,600
But it turns out that a web
page is literally just that.

110
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,020
It's a simple text file containing text
that you might type at your keyboard,

111
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,070
but it typically but not always
ends in not .txt but .html or .htm.

112
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,050
And you don't just
type words in the file.

113
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,280
You actually have to use things called
tags or, more generally, something

114
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,190
called markup language.

115
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,510
So I'm going to very quickly type
and then explain the following.

116
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,290
I'm going to first
type this, which says,

117
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,730
hey, browser, here comes a
web page written in HTML.

118
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,850
And these two things together say, hey,
browser, the following is indeed HTML.

119
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,790
Hey, browser, here comes the
head or the top of my page.

120
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,900
Hey, browser, inside of the top of
my page, put a title that is, "hello,

121
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,610
world."

122
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:08,370
Hey, browser, after the head of my
page, here comes the body of my page.

123
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,170
And, hey, browser, the body of my
page should also say, "hello world."

124
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,500
So what are the salient details here?

125
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,960
This is what's generally
called a doc-type declaration,

126
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,190
and, frankly, it's a little
hard to memorize this at first.

127
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,481
You just kind of copy-paste it.

128
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,760
This is the formal way
of saying, hey, browser,

129
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,030
I am using HTML version 5 which
came out somewhat recently.

130
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,380
It's a magical incantation that some
humans with a poor sense of design

131
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,640
decided to put at the
very top of the file.

132
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,473
Even though it's a
little arcane, that's all

133
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:38,250
it means-- hey, browser, here
comes with version 5 of HTML.

134
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,741
The rest of this has been with us
for some time now, historically,

135
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:44,740
but it's been evolving, and it's
probably been getting a little simpler.

136
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,320
Notice a few characteristics
of what I've highlighted.

137
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,890
There's these things with angled
brackets-- the left bracket

138
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,040
and the right bracket.

139
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,490
And notice the symmetry here.

140
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,340
And by symmetry, I mean, just as I
have this start tag here or an open tag

141
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,560
if you will, down here I have a
close tag or an end tag that's

142
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,460
different only insofar as it has this
slash at the beginning of the word

143
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,360
HTML.

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
And you can think of
this as I was casually

145
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,280
proposing before, hey,
browser, here comes some HTML.

146
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,060
And, conversely, hey, browser, that's
it for the HTML-- start and end.

147
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,440
Meanwhile hey, browser, here
comes the head of my page.

148
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,140
Hey, browser, that's it for the head.

149
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,240
Hey, browser, here is
the body of my page.

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,020
Hey, browser, that's it for the body.

151
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,940
And inside of that is some
arbitrary text for now.

152
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,520
And inside of the head, meanwhile,
is some arbitrary but tagged,

153
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,410
so to speak, text that says, the title
of my page shall be "hello, world."

154
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,470
Now, for now, you can
assume that browsers

155
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,762
have only-- or, rather, web pages have
only two parts-- the head and the body.

156
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:44,220
And the head is generally just
like the menu bar, the stuff

157
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,510
really just at the very top.

158
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,910
And the body is the guts of the page,
everything in that big rectangle

159
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,239
that fills the screen.

160
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:51,780
So I'm going to go ahead and do this.

161
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,400
I going to go ahead and
click Save, File Save.

162
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,580
And I'm going to save
this as hello.html,

163
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,870
and I'm just going to
put it on my desktop.

164
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,520
And I'm going to go
ahead and click Save.

165
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,806
And notice-- my Mac at
least is yelling at me.

166
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:07,180
Are you sure you want to do this?

167
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,710
And I'm going to say, yes, use HTML.

168
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,400
I know better in this case.

169
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,686
And now I'm going to go to my desktop
where I have this file suddenly.

170
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:16,060
And I'm going to double-click it.

171
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,268
And you'll notice that, by
default, Chrome opened up.

172
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:19,996
That's because that's
my default browser.

173
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:21,370
And it just says, "hello, world."

174
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,078
But it says "hello,
world" in two places.

175
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:23,979
Notice top left.

176
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:25,020
Pretty hard to miss that.

177
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,180
It's big and bold.

178
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,690
And where else does it seem
to say, "hello, world"?

179
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,470
AUDIENCE: The tab.

180
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,100
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, the tab itself.

181
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,159
So when I said the head of the
page is everything up top--

182
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,367
and indeed this is the title.

183
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:37,710
It's just in the tab here.

184
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,320
And I can pull this tab
out so as not to confuse.

185
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,360
This is just a single tab now,
and indeed we see "hello, world"

186
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,970
up here and "hello, world" down here.

187
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,160
So pretty straightforward.

188
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,050
But it's also fairly simple.

189
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,440
And, actually, I zoomed in.

190
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,272
I can change the font size just
to magnify for accessibility.

191
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:56,830
But let's now do something
a little more interesting.

192
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,760
I'm going to go-- whoops, let
me get back to my text file.

193
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm going back to my
text file, and I'm going

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,320
to change this and say
"hello, Disney World."

195
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,970
Save.

196
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,919
And go back to my
browser and click Reload.

197
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,710
And now, of course, it
says "Disney World."

198
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,500
And I'm going to artificially zoom
in just so it's easier to see.

199
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,012
So now, unfortunately, I kind of want
to-- actually, that's a Mac feature.

200
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:21,720
I want to click on Disney World
and go somewhere like disney.com,

201
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,290
but that doesn't work.

202
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:26,850
So a basic tenet of the web is
hyperlinks, links that go elsewhere.

203
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,390
So how do I do that?

204
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,690
Well, I could just say,
"hello, http://www.disney.com."

205
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,110
Save this.

206
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,620
Reload.

207
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,400
But this too, not clickable.

208
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,930
And what's nice here, even though
this is not functional yet,

209
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,930
is that it seems that the
browser literally only does

210
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,950
what I tell it to do.

211
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,110
So if I just type a URL like this,
it's just going to show me the URL.

212
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,270
I need to use tags or markup
language to actually tell

213
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,621
the browser to do even more.

214
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:57,870
So I'm going to go ahead and
delete this for a moment.

215
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,980
And I'm going to say, hey,
browser, start an anchor here,

216
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,650
a link so to speak.

217
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,500
And the hyper-reference, the destination
of that anchor, should be this URL.

218
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,750
And notice my quotes.

219
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,590
I could use single quotes, too,
but you have to be consistent,

220
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,270
and I would generally just use
double quotes to keep it simple.

221
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,820
Notice I'm going to close the tag.

222
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,160
And then here I'm going
to say, "Disney World."

223
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,890
And now I need some symmetry--
open bracket, /a, closed bracket.

224
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,090
So what have I introduced?

225
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,100
We've had a few tags already.

226
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,410
HTML, Head, Title, Body,
are all tags, so to speak,

227
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,280
with open and closed counterparts.

228
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,530
But notice, this is sort
of fundamentally different.

229
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,140
This is what we'll call
in HTML an attribute.

230
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,451
And an attribute is
just a key-value pair.

231
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:43,950
This is a common thing in
computer science-- key-value pair.

232
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,770
It's sort of the tool of the trade.

233
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,040
A key and a value.

234
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,390
A word and then some
other word or words.

235
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,790
And in this case, the key is href,
and the value is that full URL.

236
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,890
And what an attribute does is it
influences the behavior of a tag.

237
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,010
And in this case, we need to influence
the behavior of the anchor tag,

238
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,140
because we need to anchor
this link to somewhere.

239
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,960
And how you do that is
by way of the attribute.

240
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,970
So I'm going to go ahead
and save the file now.

241
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,300
Go back to my browser and reload.

242
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,580
And, voila, we now have the
beginnings of a legitimate web page.

243
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,420
Super-simple, but if I hover over
this-- notice in the bottom-left corner,

244
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,830
it's super-small.

245
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,730
But you do see www.disney.com.

246
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,076
And if I click it, indeed this
whisks me away to disney.com.

247
00:11:27,076 --> 00:11:29,380
Now, the curious thing
here is that it is not

248
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,940
the best-- the most marketable URL, but
that's fine because this file does not

249
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,360
exist on the World Wide Web.

250
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,740
It exists as a local file in apparently
my Users directory-- /jharvard--

251
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,890
for John Harvard-- /desktop.

252
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,634
But it has a URL.

253
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:43,800
It just happens to be local.

254
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,050
Unfortunately, none of you can visit
this, because if you type this URL,

255
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,980
you'd be telling your browser,
look for a file called hello.html

256
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,772
on your hard drive.

257
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:53,271
And, of course, unless you've
been following along manually,

258
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:54,530
it's not going to exist there.

259
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,190
So that's fine.

260
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,815
We still need a way, ultimately,
to get this file into the web,

261
00:11:57,815 --> 00:12:01,180
but let's tease apart a couple of
security implications of what we just

262
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,850
saw and tie it back to the earlier
discussion from this morning.

263
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,200
It turns out that, if a
browser literally just does

264
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,560
what I tell it to do, and it seems
to be the case that an anchor tag is

265
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,380
influenced by the value of
this attribute called href

266
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,810
but it displays this
text, this would seem

267
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,520
to imply that I could put the URL
in both places and then reload

268
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,100
and now see the URL and go to the URL.

269
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,680
Notice, if I hover over the bottom-left,
I'm indeed going still to disney.com.

270
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,340
So if you've ever been
phished-- P-H-I-S-H-E-D--

271
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,820
with one of those bogus emails
from like PayPal your bank,

272
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,470
you've probably gotten links inside
of the email that you're reading that

273
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,970
tells you to click here to go confirm
your password or confirm your birthdate

274
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,840
or social or something socially
engineering you to disclose

275
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,920
information.

276
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,625
Well, I could kind of take
advantage of this, couldn't I?

277
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,240
I could say something
like, www.paypal.com.

278
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:11,340
And instead of disney.com, I
could go to, like, badguy.com.

279
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,850
Reload.

280
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,620
And how easy is it to dupe,
especially a non-technical reader

281
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,649
or a cursorily reading
reader than to click

282
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,940
a link like this, which if I click it--
I actually don't want to go badguy.com.

283
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,398
I don't know what's actually there.

284
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:30,080
So paypal.com, notice, is
what it says it's going to,

285
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,210
but of course, if I look down
super-low, it's a little blurry,

286
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,230
but it says badguy.com.

287
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,644
That's the only tell right now
that I'm going to the wrong place.

288
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:41,560
And when I said earlier that banks
really shouldn't encourage or train

289
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,510
users into clicking links, this
is just one manifestation of it.

290
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,430
And it's that simple.

291
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,120
You are now an adversary if
you do something like this

292
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,000
and try to trick a user
into visiting your website.

293
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,320
But for now, we'll keep
things nice and clean.

294
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,640
We're going to go ahead
and rewind these changes.

295
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,530
Reload the page.

296
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,740
And I go back to disney.com.

297
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,660
Let's see if we can't tease
this apart a little more.

298
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,160
So "hello, Disney World."

299
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,950
I'm going to say down here.

300
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,220
Maybe I'm going to make some room.

301
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,730
"We hope you enjoy your stay!"

302
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,830
Save.

303
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,850
Reload.

304
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,010
It's not rea-- that's not
what I intended, right?

305
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,870
I mean, if I'm treating my text
file like a word processor,

306
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,894
what did you hope would happen here?

307
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:27,060
Yeah, I feel like there
should be a line break here,

308
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,799
so it feels buggy in some way.

309
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,090
But that's actually deliberate,
because just as before,

310
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,381
the browser is only going to
do what you tell it to do.

311
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:34,806
I have not told it to break lines.

312
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,930
I've not told it to move down, even
though, intuitively, I feel like I did.

313
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,805
So it turns out we need
a little more markup,

314
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,390
and I'm going to fix this as follows.

315
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,160
I'm going to preface this first hello
with what's called a paragraph tag.

316
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,920
And then I'm going to go ahead
and wrap this other sentence

317
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,370
in another paragraph tag, even though
they're super-short paragraphs.

318
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,930
Now I'm going to save.

319
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,160
Reload.

320
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,070
And now we have that
space, and we sort of

321
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,680
have the semantics of
two separate paragraphs.

322
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,290
That's all fine and good, but it would
be nice to add an image to this page,

323
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,710
so I'm going to go look for
Mickey Mouse on Google Images.

324
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,830
And just for fun, I'm
going to grab this image.

325
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,350
I'm going to go ahead now and
grab the URL of this image,

326
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,510
though there's different
ways to do this.

327
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,520
For now, I'm just going to copy the URL.

328
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,770
I'm going to go back into my text
file, and I'm going to say here,

329
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:31,160
img src= quote unquote
that URL, super-long.

330
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,580
And then the notion of an
image is a little different.

331
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,640
There's really no notion of starting
an image and ending an image,

332
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,630
like a start tag an end tag.

333
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,840
So it feels a little weird to
me semantically to do this,

334
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,390
to have a close-image tag.

335
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,780
It's not incorrect.

336
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,840
It's perfectly correct,
and it's encouraged,

337
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,870
but there's shorthand notation.

338
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,780
I can kind of simultaneously
open and close the same tag,

339
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,510
and that will make the browser happy.

340
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,950
So it's just a little
more succinct for things

341
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,408
that conceptually really don't
make sense to start and end.

342
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,190
They just are there, or they're not.

343
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,020
So I'm going to save this and go back
to my "hello, world" page and reload.

344
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,880
And it's a little out of control,
because that image is actually

345
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,210
a little large, but that's OK.

346
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,710
I could resize it in a program.

347
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,900
Or you know what.

348
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,350
Just to demonstrate, I'm
going to actually say

349
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:21,760
that the width of this thing should
only be 200 pixels, 200 dots.

350
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,360
Let me go ahead and save
and reload, and now the page

351
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,690
looks a little more reasonable.

352
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,260
But notice the pattern.

353
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,030
Well, I've kind of taught you all
of HTML in some sense, at least

354
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,531
conceptually, because all HTML is is
these tags-- open tags, closed tags,

355
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:35,280
and attributes that
modify their behavior.

356
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,380
And, apparently, every
tag can have zero or one

357
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,005
or two or more attributes, each of
which does something a little different.

358
00:16:43,005 --> 00:16:44,380
Now, how do you know what exists?

359
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,800
You just listen to someone
like me tell you what exists,

360
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,860
or you just Google around for a tutorial
on HTML, and it really is this simple.

361
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,030
Truly, when I was an undergrad
years ago and learned HTML,

362
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,530
one of my math teaching
assistants just spent

363
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,600
a little bit of time tutoring me
for like half an hour, an hour,

364
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,660
and then I was on my way.

365
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,300
I was on my way toward making
the most hideous websites ever,

366
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,549
which, apparently, I haven't
really progressed beyond.

367
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:09,849
But the point is that, once you
understand these simple ideas--

368
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,450
if arcane text-- but these simple
ideas of starting a thought

369
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,960
and closing a thought, keeping
everything nicely balanced,

370
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,150
looking something up, modifying the
behavior of that tag, that's really all

371
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,079
there is to it.

372
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:28,140
And in fact, if we now go to
something like google.com-- actually,

373
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,920
let's go a place a little more
reasonable-- stanford.edu.

374
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,800
And I'm going to go to View,
Developer, View Source.

375
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,400
It's ugly, but notice--
and I'll zoom in notice

376
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,432
some stuff that's familiar already.

377
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:45,140
There's this up here,
which is a browser.

378
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,800
Here comes HTML5.

379
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,634
There's HTML.

380
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,550
Apparently, there's an
attribute that I didn't

381
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,540
use that specifies the
language of the page,

382
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,380
and this can help with automatic
translation and stuff like that.

383
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,546
Here's the head of the page.

384
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,790
Here's the title of Stanford's page.

385
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,832
There's a tag I didn't
talk about yet-- Meta tag.

386
00:17:59,832 --> 00:18:01,540
It's just sort of
background information.

387
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,210
It helps with SEO, or
search-engine optimization,

388
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,320
or Google-search results or the like.

389
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,029
But if we keep looking, keep
looking, here's the Body tag.

390
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:11,570
And there's bunches of other
tags we've not talked about yet.

391
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,750
But Div is one for a
division of the page.

392
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,680
It's like an invisible rectangle
if you kind of want to mentally

393
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,160
divide your page into
different units online.

394
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,650
And then lots of divs I
see, something called Class,

395
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,440
but we'll come back to that.

396
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,200
This is interesting-- Forms.

397
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,730
Forms are all over the web.

398
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,310
Any search box you're
ever used is a form.

399
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,490
And, so, let's actually see.

400
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,790
Form.

401
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,910
Action.

402
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,660
The action of this form, for whatever
historical reasons, is that URL.

403
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,840
Method is "post."

404
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,060
Turns out that HTTP requests can use
the verb "get," like we saw before,

405
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,070
or "post."

406
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,030
And will see a difference
of this in a moment.

407
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,363
Let's actually see what this is.

408
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:49,830
Let me go back to Stanford's page.

409
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,330
What form are they talking
about, do you think?

410
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,485
What jumps out at you?

411
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:54,970
AUDIENCE: Search box.

412
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,845
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.

413
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:58,410
So up at the top right
here is this Search box.

414
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,441
And that's how they implemented it-- a
tag that's literally open-bracket form.

415
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,940
And then let's search for something.

416
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,220
Let's search for a buddy
of mine-- "Nick Parlante."

417
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,380
Enter.

418
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,750
And of course, it went to
a slightly different URL.

419
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,140
Let me go back here.

420
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,960
Let's search for "courses."

421
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,460
Damn it.

422
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,484
Went to a different URL.

423
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:23,400
So, Stanford's adding some magic
that they're not taking me to the URL

424
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,820
that we saw in the
action attribute there.

425
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:32,480
But this form here is implemented purely
by way of this markup here, these tags.

426
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,710
In fact, here's the input for
the type of search that you want.

427
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,940
Here is the input for
another type of search.

428
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,960
Here is the input for the string itself.

429
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,394
And so the goal is not to wrap
our minds around all of these tags

430
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,060
but just to see.

431
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,300
It's just opening and closing
tags and looking things up.

432
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,560
Yeah?

433
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:48,920
Victoria?

434
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,795
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

435
00:19:49,795 --> 00:19:51,925


436
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,550
DAVID J. MALAN: That's a good question.

437
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,660
That's a little trickier to see.

438
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,300
Let me come back to that
question in just a few minutes

439
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,000
when we look at something called
CSS, or cascading style sheets,

440
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,500
and we can try to infer
as much from the page.

441
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,090
So if we now take a look at google.com,
let's see what their page looks like.

442
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,840
You would they're-- that's cute today.

443
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,490


444
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:12,990
OK.

445
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,690
All done.

446
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,260
All right, so View Source.

447
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,590
You would think Google has
really nice source code.

448
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,970
So, apparently, what is going on here?

449
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,880
And in fact, this is not even HTML.

450
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,930
This is something called JavaScript.

451
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,344
And let's keep going and going.

452
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,010
I don't even know where the page starts.

453
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,240
I'm going to use Command
F, open bracket HTML.

454
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,200
All right, there it is.

455
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:44,150
I found the start of the page, and
there is so much stuff in here.

456
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,310
What is actually going on?

457
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,460
Well, you know what,
we can clean this up.

458
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,109
If I instead go to this Inspect
toolbar, this special diagnostic tool,

459
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:54,150
and go not to Network,
where we keep going today,

460
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:56,420
but if I go to Elements,
what's really nice

461
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,990
is that a browser has a lot
much better eyes than I do.

462
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,670
And the browser can read
that mess of a web page,

463
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,700
that HTML mail we just
looked at, and it can

464
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,340
parse it or read and
analyze it and reformat it

465
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,910
in a nice human-friendly way.

466
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,740
So what I'm seeing now
in this screen here

467
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,470
under Elements, the exact same content,
but they've indented everything,

468
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,140
they've colorized it, but
it's the exact same text

469
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,620
that I downloaded from the server.

470
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,630
And what's nice now is I can see
in the body, for instance-- notice,

471
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,480
the page is still composed
of just a head and a body,

472
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,660
and I can hierarchically dive in here.

473
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,420
Notice that Google seems to have
to divs-- this one and this one.

474
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,310
I can expand that.

475
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,370
There's a whole bunch of other divs.

476
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,900
So it's a little complex.

477
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,400
But wait.

478
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,970
This seems so much more
readable, relatively, than this.

479
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,840
Why is Google embarrassing
itself by just sending

480
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,400
this huge mess of code of some
sort just to implement something

481
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,640
that looks so simple at first glance?

482
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,270
Like, why don't they add more spaces?

483
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,811
Why didn't they hit Enter like I did?

484
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:59,110
Look how good I was
at writing a web page.

485
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,680
I hit Enter so diligently.

486
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,760
I indented so everything
is so pretty and readable.

487
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,463
Why does Google not practice the same?

488
00:22:08,463 --> 00:22:11,409
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

489
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:12,305


490
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:13,180
DAVID J. MALAN: Good.

491
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,270
Very fair.

492
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,650
They do not have some
person at Google manually

493
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,160
updating the home page anymore.

494
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,010
It's not 1999 anymore.

495
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,140
So they have software.

496
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,397
They have other tools that
generate dynamically they're HTML.

497
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,480
Of course, that code itself
was written by humans,

498
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,220
but the reality is,
it's quite fair to say,

499
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,340
the browser certainly doesn't
care how messy the code is.

500
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,940
But there's an even more
compelling technical reason

501
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:42,580
that Google distributes their HTML
code in such a sloppy, seemingly

502
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,350
overwhelming way all packed together
with very little way-- very little

503
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,274
in the way of formatting like I did.

504
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:52,570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

505
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,528
DAVID J. MALAN: Faster?

506
00:22:53,528 --> 00:22:54,040
Why?

507
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,680
And what did you say, Lydia?

508
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,240
Faster?

509
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,281
Why faster?

510
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,156
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

511
00:22:58,156 --> 00:23:00,522


512
00:23:00,522 --> 00:23:02,230
DAVID J. MALAN: There's
no space to read.

513
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,730
Yeah.

514
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,560
So think about what a space is.

515
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,394
So each character on the keyboard takes
some amount of space to represent,

516
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:10,560
either physically, like it
takes up that much space,

517
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,250
or somehow underneath the
hood, that requires memory.

518
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,740
And as an aside-- and we'll
talk more about this tomorrow--

519
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,930
every character on the keyboard
typically requires 8 bits, or one byte.

520
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,360
So a pattern of 8 zeros or
ones, or just 1 byte, as we

521
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,720
humans would typically say.

522
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,690
So that's small, but
it's still non-zero.

523
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,940
It's still some amount of space.

524
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:36,082
So if an engineer or Google hits
the space bar just once, and suppose

525
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,540
Google-- it's super-popular--
suppose that a billion people

526
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,780
visit their home page a day,
or some number of people

527
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,290
visit the home page a
billion times a day,

528
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:48,890
how many additional bytes has that
software engineer just cost Google

529
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,310
by hitting his or her space bar once?

530
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,692
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

531
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,150
DAVID J. MALAN: Not quite that bad.

532
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,070
Just one byte times a billion.

533
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,871
So a--

534
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,120
AUDIENCE: 8 billion gigabytes.

535
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,370
DAVID J. MALAN: Not 8 billion.

536
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,240
8 billion bytes.

537
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,410
But 1 gigabyte.

538
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,080
1 gigabyte would be the unit of measure.

539
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,240
If he or she does two
spaces, 2 gigabytes.

540
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,030
Three gigabytes.

541
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,530
Right?

542
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,860
It scales expensively.

543
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,150
And so in cases like Google,
which, granted, are extreme cases,

544
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,450
there are other issues that arise just
by making very reasonable decisions

545
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,744
or taking very simple human actions,
because it has this magnified effect.

546
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:27,660
So one of the reasons
this looks so compressed

547
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,660
is exactly as Victoria said-- it was
just generated by computers anyway.

548
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,900
So no big deal.

549
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,309
Let the browser figure it out.

550
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,350
But it also deliberately
doesn't have much space,

551
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,766
because the space isn't necessary.

552
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,250
And the space actually costs money.

553
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,670
It either costs time,
because just to push

554
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,670
that much more data out of
google.com's headquarters just

555
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:47,710
has got to take some amount of
time, even if it's milliseconds

556
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,190
or microseconds, but that adds up
over so many users, or more likely,

557
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,270
it probably costs money.

558
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,690
Google probably connects to
someone else in the world, one

559
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,398
of those peering
points, and if they have

560
00:24:56,398 --> 00:24:59,880
some kind of financial relationship
whereby their data costs money,

561
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,730
they might as well
minimize how much data

562
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,530
they're spitting out on
their internet connection.

563
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,630
So the funny thing, though, ultimately,
or maybe the reassuring thing,

564
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:11,030
is that even though this looks terribly
overwhelming, at the end of the day,

565
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,750
it's still the exact same principles as
this very simple page here of an HTML

566
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,390
page.

567
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,610
So just to summarize and so that you
have a canonical version if you weren't

568
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:25,900
following along by choice here, here
might be the most simple of web pages,

569
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,240
so something to play with perhaps later.

570
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,790
Well, let's introduce a
couple of other ideas now.

571
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,420
We're about to introduce
something called a style tag.

572
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,110
We can stylize this page
in more interesting ways.

573
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,860
So whereas HTML email
is all about marking up

574
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,470
the data, sort of specifying to a
browser how to structure the data,

575
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,110
where to put it, CSS, or
cascading style sheets,

576
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,640
is a second language that
generally gets commingled with HTML

577
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,670
as we'll see-- but we can clean
that up in a moment-- that takes

578
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,850
it the final mile, and it stylizes it.

579
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,460
It gets the colors just right,
the font sizes just right,

580
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,860
the positioning just right.

581
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,510
It's all about the aesthetics
or formatting, not about

582
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,330
the fundamental data itself.

583
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,390
And the easiest way to show
this is perhaps by example.

584
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,320
So I'm going to go over
to my simple text file.

585
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,970
And in just a moment, I'll
walk us through the process

586
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,360
of doing this ourselves.

587
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,310
I'm going to go back to my file
here and reload the page just

588
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,800
to confirm what it looks like.

589
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,190
That's where we're at now.

590
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,170
I feel like kids would enjoy
having some color to this web page.

591
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,480
So I'm going to go up here
into the head of the page.

592
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,130
And I'm going to do style, /style.

593
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:44,060
And then inside of this, I'm going
to tell the body of my page--

594
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,870
and this formatting is, at
first glance, perhaps a little

595
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,400
strange but conventional.

596
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,010
I'm going to say that the background
color of this page should be green.

597
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,960
And this is unfortunately
sort of not the best design.

598
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,710
Notice that previously
in the world of HTML,

599
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,190
I said that attributes
are these key-value pairs.

600
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,760
Something equals quote
unquote "something."

601
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,810
In the world of CSS, which was
designed by some different people,

602
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,020
they decided that, in their
world, key-value pairs

603
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,920
would be word colon something.

604
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,220
So it's the same idea, though.

605
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:18,620
It's associating a value
with some key that somehow

606
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,330
influences the behavior of this page.

607
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,901
And you can probably guess.

608
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:24,150
What is this probably going
to do even if you've never

609
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,867
seen HTML or CSS before?

610
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:29,450
AUDIENCE: Change the background color.

611
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,560
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah,
change the background color.

612
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,280
And specifically the
background color of the body.

613
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,290
But insofar as the
body for now is the web

614
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,870
page-- it's the only thing
below the title bar really--

615
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,870
it's probably going to
influence the same thing.

616
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,430
So let's see.

617
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,490
Let's save this.

618
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,310
Go here and reload.

619
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,140
It's pretty hideous.

620
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,070
And what's going on
here is a side effect.

621
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,850
I just chose this image randomly.

622
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,305
Why is the green not
permeating behind Mickey?

623
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

624
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,880


625
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.

626
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,750
It turns out that images, pretty
much all images that we might use,

627
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,670
are all rectangles-- of rectangles.

628
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,710
Even if Mickey has some curves
to himself and has a background,

629
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,330
that background has to be something.

630
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,280
It has to be white.

631
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,910
It has to be black or something else.

632
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,650
It can be transparent.

633
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,100
And in fact, I could
open Mickey Mouse here

634
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,590
in a program called Photoshop
or something similar

635
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,176
and change all of that white
background to transparent,

636
00:28:21,176 --> 00:28:22,550
so the green would shine through.

637
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,980
But that's something I would need
to ask of myself or a graphic artist

638
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,130
or a designer at my
company, for instance,

639
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,490
to do, especially since I just
borrowed this one from the internet.

640
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,030
But that's why this is happening.

641
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,980
So what else might we want to do?

642
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:41,040
Well, we might want to say we
really hope you enjoy your stay.

643
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,150
And for emphasis, I want
to make this strong,

644
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,310
and so I'll say open strong and
close strong and then reload.

645
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,320
And it's a little hard
to see on the projector

646
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,250
but perhaps really now
jumps out at you a bit more.

647
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,180
So you can add italics in this
way, bold facing in this way.

648
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,500
We could change the colors.

649
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,610
In fact, just for kicks, I'm
going to go ahead and do this.

650
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,120
I don't really like how my
paragraphs are this close together,

651
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,870
so I might do something like this.

652
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:13,310
I'm going to tell the browser,
change every paragraph tag to have,

653
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,952
let's say-- actually, you know what,
let's align it text-align, center.

654
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:19,410
And again, I know this only
because someone taught it to me

655
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,118
or I looked it up in
an online reference.

656
00:29:21,118 --> 00:29:22,450
So let me save this.

657
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,070
And, ah, now I've
centered the image there.

658
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,490
And actually, you know what, if
I move my image into a paragraph

659
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:34,510
tag-- so a third paragraph,
even though it's not text.

660
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,917
Let's save that and reload.

661
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:40,000
Now the page is starting to look kind
of-- I mean, it's still pretty ugly,

662
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,180
but at least it looks like I spent
two minutes instead of one minute

663
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,950
making it.

664
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,200
And so, incrementally, can we make
these aesthetic changes now to the page?

665
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,860
I've not really changed the data in the
page other than adding the word really.

666
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,650
I've added metadata, if you will.

667
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,830
Hey, browser, make the
word "really" bold.

668
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,940
But the data is not strong.

669
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,830
That's metadata.

670
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,410
The data is "really."

671
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,200
So we still have some of
the same concepts as before.

672
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,990
Now, of course, this is not on the web,
so I'm going to do one final step here.

673
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,300
I'm going to go to hello.html
and just highlight and copy this.

674
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,285
And now I'm going to
go into Cloud9, which

675
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:13,910
I'll walk you through in just a moment.

676
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,080
And odds are you'll soon be, if
not already, at a screen like this.

677
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,080
And let me just give you a quick
tour of what Cloud9 actually is.

678
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,590
So again cloud 9 is
this cloud-based service

679
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,580
that gives you and me the illusion
of having our own virtual machine

680
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,090
in the cloud, technically
a container in the cloud,

681
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,160
that we have full
administrative privileges to.

682
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,130
So in theory, no one
else in the world has

683
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,152
access to the screen I'm
looking at right now,

684
00:30:39,152 --> 00:30:40,860
except maybe the people
who run the site,

685
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,470
because technically they have
physical access and so forth.

686
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,740
So what do we see in this environment?

687
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,230
I'm going to zoom out,
because it's a little small.

688
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,104
And let me point over
here for just a moment.

689
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:53,210
On the left-hand side of my and your
screen, there's a file browser at left.

690
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,362
So similar in spirit
to Mac OS and Windows.

691
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:57,070
These are all of the
files in my account.

692
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,250
And by default, if your
account is like mine,

693
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:05,090
you'll see or soon see
helloworld.html and readme.md.

694
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,950
Over here on the right, this is
where my text files are going to go.

695
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,620
If you've ever used Microsoft
Word or Notepad or TextEdit,

696
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,100
this is word my editing
of files is going to go.

697
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,540
And then the most arcane
feature of this environment

698
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,100
that we won't really need to use is
down here called a Terminal Window.

699
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,390
If you've used DOS from
yesteryear, this is the Linux

700
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,450
or the Linux equivalent of DOS.

701
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,190
It's a text-based interface--
no mouse clicks, no dragging.

702
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,770
All you can do is type
commands, but those commands

703
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,400
can create files, move files, open
directories, close directories,

704
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,740
do any number of things.

705
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,060
But for now, we'll just
spend our time up here.

706
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,050
And so let's do this.

707
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,008
If you're in this
environment, which you should

708
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:45,900
be if you created a workspace
already, go ahead and just go up

709
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,690
to File, New for a moment.

710
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:51,740
And that will give you a new
tab right here in the middle.

711
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,250
And I just-- and let's
go ahead and do this.

712
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:59,910
Let's go ahead and now do File, Save
and go ahead and call it hello.html,

713
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,740
not to be confused with
helloworld.html, which

714
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,910
came with your new free account,
which is just a sample file.

715
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:11,020
You will see it suddenly appear,
most likely on the left-hand side,

716
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,810
and the tab will still be open.

717
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:21,300
And let me encourage you now to recreate
this file or some variants thereof.

718
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,607
And if you can't quite see it on the
screen, this is identical to the slides

719
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,190
that you probably have in another tab.

720
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,296
So in short, make your first web page,
save it, and then in just a moment,

721
00:32:29,296 --> 00:32:31,170
I'll show you how you
can actually view this.

722
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,970
But change at least one thing.

723
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,400
Change helloworld to
something of your own choice,

724
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,821
so that you're convinced that it's your
file and not the one I just created.

725
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:40,320
All right.

726
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,804
And when you're ready-- no
rush-- when you're ready,

727
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:46,220
go ahead and save the file
once you've made these changes.

728
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,540
And if you click the
Run button up top, this

729
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,610
should open a new tab that will tell
you what URL you can visit your file at,

730
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,380
but it might take a moment to
quote unquote "start Apache," which

731
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,820
is the name of the web server.

732
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,430
So be careful to do exactly
what's in the file ultimately.

733
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,610
So right now, I'll zoom in.

734
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:07,780
If I start typing
open-bracket HTML, notice

735
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,650
it's prompting me to finish my thought.

736
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,750
And if I finished my thought, it
automatically gives me the closing tag.

737
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,190
But the expectation is then I'll hit
Enter, and then move inside there

738
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,180
and do head inside and
then I do body inside.

739
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,430
And it's a little weird at first,
because it's doing work for you,

740
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,110
but realize that ultimately
it saves you keystrokes.

741
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,500
And in fact, a very common feature of
programming environments these days

742
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,260
both for web development like
this and actual programming,

743
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,960
which we'll talk about tomorrow,
is these auto-complete features,

744
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,710
things that just allow a
programmer or a designer

745
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,010
to type fewer keystrokes to
accomplish the same thing.

746
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,176
Sometimes it's good, though.

747
00:33:43,176 --> 00:33:44,560
Sometimes it's just annoying.

748
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,290


749
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:54,010
And, again, once you've transcribed
the slide or some variant thereof,

750
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:57,360
you can click the Run button up top.

751
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,910
And then in the bottom
window, you'll be informed

752
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,290
at what URL you can visit your web page.

753
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:08,790
Mine, for instance, is at
business-daharvard.c9users.io

754
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,480
and so forth.

755
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,580
All right, so, let me-- any questions?

756
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:19,460
Any other questions about just getting
this working before we add features?

757
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,692
And let me propose, just
to get folks comfortable--

758
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,400
because it's one thing to just
copy-paste blindly what I've done.

759
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,177
But just so that folks wrestle
with at least one to-do,

760
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:28,510
I'm going to turn on some music.

761
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,630
I'm going to propose a list of
things you can potentially add.

762
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,086
And you can certainly use Google.

763
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:36,210
And why don't we just
propose that you try to solve

764
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,710
at least one particular problem here.

765
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:45,090
So in terms of tags,
let me reuse this here.

766
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,280
Actually, let me put
it in a textual form.

767
00:34:48,280 --> 00:35:02,380
Let's say that among the tags we might
use here are some tags over here.

768
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,090
We've seen the paragraph tag.

769
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,850
Now it's going to auto-complete.

770
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:12,220
Paragraph tag, the anchor tag.

771
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,250
Let's say you want to
make something bigger,

772
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,480
so you might like--
the span tag can help.

773
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,010
Well, you might need some help
for that in just a moment.

774
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,830
We've seen div.

775
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,170
You'll see there's table.

776
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,928
There something called tr, td.

777
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:30,736


778
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:32,860
Th, td.

779
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,770
Come back to that in a moment.

780
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,590
What else might be handy?

781
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,310
There's strong.

782
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:43,640
There's emphasis, or rather em.

783
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:50,110
There's-- what else
might you fancy here?

784
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,930
Well, we'll take a
look at that together.

785
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,230
Form, which we've seen.

786
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,130
There's form.

787
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,500
There's input and a few others.

788
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,924


789
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:00,090
All right, so let's do this.

790
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,330
To answer a Victoria's
question, let me first

791
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,020
just make sure that everyone is
able to get their hello working.

792
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,900
Then let me introduce
a couple other ideas.

793
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,209
Then we'll let folks solve
some problem on their own.

794
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,500
Then we'll actually come back
to that notion of a form,

795
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,950
and we'll actually re-implement
together the front-end interface,

796
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,450
so to speak, for Google itself.

797
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,700
We'll use Google as the back end and let
them do the hard work, the searching,

798
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,760
but we'll recreate the front end
of Google and the search form

799
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,520
that they have on their own home page.

800
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,050
And so we'll come back to
these tags in just a moment.

801
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,270
So this was what I
proposed just a moment ago.

802
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,940
We can add the stylization to a
page inside of this style tag,

803
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,950
and we can stylize the background
color, the text alignment,

804
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,000
whether it's center or left or right.

805
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,630
But very quickly you would
find or a web designer

806
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,060
would find that this
becomes a little unwieldy,

807
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,330
because you're doing what's
called mixing content

808
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,120
with presentation thereof.

809
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,756
You're mixing your data
and the aesthetics thereof.

810
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:56,380
And in fact, if you consider
what's going to happen over time--

811
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,350
this is a very small
web page, of course.

812
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,590
But if I add content to this page
and I add style to this page,

813
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,650
the page very quickly gets
longer and longer and longer.

814
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,510
And suppose that I want
have a second web page that

815
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,010
shares some of these attributes.

816
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,350
Suppose my second web page for my
site-- also, I want everything center,

817
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,960
and I also want everything
with a green background.

818
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,940
I'm pretty much going to have to
copy and paste some of these lines

819
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,730
into that second file, which feels fine.

820
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,030
It will solve the problem.

821
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:26,060
But what if I want a third page
or a 30th page or a 40th page?

822
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,730
Now I'm going to be copying and
pasting a lot of duplicate code

823
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,430
in multiple files.

824
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,600
And so suppose that
I decide or I'm told,

825
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,780
hey, we're not using a
green background anymore.

826
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,380
We're going to start using orange.

827
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,690
What do you have to change?

828
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,900
Well, you have to change that style
from green to orange in how many places?

829
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,920
Like 30 or 40 places.

830
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,900
It's tedious.

831
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,039
It's prone to error.

832
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,580
There's a number of reasons
where you wouldn't want to induce

833
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,840
that kind of pain for yourself.

834
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,760
And so wouldn't it be nice
if we could take what I just

835
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,240
put between these two yellow
tags, these style tags,

836
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,050
factor it out, and put all of my
stylization into one central file

837
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,470
that all 30 or 40 of my other files
borrow from or somehow reference,

838
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,640
not unlike the networking
diagrams we were doing before?

839
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,030
So if I go in here, I'm
going to actually propose

840
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,880
that we replace the
style tag with something

841
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,620
called the link tag, which
is horribly, horribly named,

842
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,370
because you do not use the
link tag to create what

843
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,380
we humans know as a link in a web page.

844
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,750
For that, you use which tag?

845
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,464
How do you create a link in a web page?

846
00:38:31,464 --> 00:38:32,130
AUDIENCE: The a.

847
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,870
DAVID J. MALAN: The a, or anchor
tag, that went to Disney before.

848
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:39,090
The link tag here is saying
this-- link to a file called

849
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:44,350
styles.css, the relationship to which
is going to be that it's my stylesheet.

850
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,290
So this is one of the S's in
CSS-- cascading style sheets.

851
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,490
Style sheet-- two of the S's in CSS.

852
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,550
Cascading style sheet.

853
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:58,640
This just means, hey, browser, go
find styles.css on the local server

854
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,870
and use it as your stylesheet,
which means inside of that file

855
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,310
is going to be all of the
stylizations that we've just done.

856
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,396
And so what that file
might look like is this.

857
00:39:07,396 --> 00:39:10,020
And I'll just do this is a quick
example, because we don't need

858
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,000
to get too much into the weeds here.

859
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,840
But if I copy this, what I'm proposing
is that a programmer create a new file,

860
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:24,450
paste in those lines--
whoops-- paste in those lines,

861
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:32,270
save it as styles.css, and then, in
the other file, delete all of that

862
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,450
and replace it instead
with this link tag.

863
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:43,090
So that if I link href="styles.css",
the relationship shall be "stylesheet"

864
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,170
close tag.

865
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,250
Save it.

866
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,000
Go back to my helloworld.

867
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,690
Reload.

868
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:51,290
Literally nothing has happened.

869
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,710
That is a good thing, because it
means it's actually all working.

870
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,860
To prove as much, suppose I make a
typo, and I call this "Styles.css"

871
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:03,080
with a capital S, which is
incorrect, and then reload.

872
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,470
Now you can see it just doesn't work.

873
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,362
Now, why?

874
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,070
Well, let's use a
technique from earlier.

875
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,153
Let me go ahead and, in
my browser, in Chrome, I'm

876
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:12,900
going to open up that special
network tab as before,

877
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,560
and let me reload the page.

878
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,341
What are you not surprised to see now?

879
00:40:19,341 --> 00:40:20,840
Or maybe you're surprised to see it.

880
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,225
Either way, what do you see now?

881
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:24,100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

882
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:24,770
DAVID J. MALAN: It's not found.

883
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,680
Why is it not found?

884
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,480
Well, Styles.css-- capital
S-- does not exist.

885
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,230
I misnamed it.

886
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,430
Simple typo.

887
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,816
But I'm getting understandably now a
404, because the server is saying, hey,

888
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:34,440
it's not found.

889
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,300
Literally, I don't know
where that file is.

890
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,880
So as a result, the browser
shows you what it can,

891
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,860
the raw content of the page,
which was a 200, the HTML,

892
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,390
but the stylization can't
be added thereafter.

893
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,120
And this is what's meant by cascading.

894
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,070
You can sort of add it
after, and it sort of

895
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,874
refines the aesthetics of the web page.

896
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:53,790
And you can even override those
styles with yet other stylesheet files

897
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,700
if you want.

898
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,780
It's not found, though, in this case,
because of course, I misnamed it.

899
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,330
So I would have to fix that first.

900
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:04,667
So let's go ahead and
propose the following.

901
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,410


902
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,140
Let's go ahead and do this.

903
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,220
Starting with perhaps
your helloworld file,

904
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,740
let me just invite a couple
of feature suggestions.

905
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,400
So, Victoria, you wanted to
make some text bigger, right?

906
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,555
All right, so we can
do make text bigger.

907
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:26,860
And we'll each pluck off
just one problem to solve.

908
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:30,867
Make text bigger.

909
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,700
I'm not going to bother
writing this when we

910
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,600
have bullet technology right over here.

911
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,970
So some problems.

912
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,670
So we're going to try
to make text bigger.

913
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,170
All right.

914
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,360
What else would someone propose?

915
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,332
What else might we want
to do in a web page?

916
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:52,040
Let's come up with a
short list of things

917
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,366
and then delegate to the
group to figure this out.

918
00:41:55,366 --> 00:41:56,270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

919
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:02,251
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, position text
on different sides of the page?

920
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:02,750
All right.

921
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,620
Something else.

922
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,784
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

923
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:06,700
DAVID J. MALAN: It is.

924
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,720
So a gif is just a
different file format.

925
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,830
We just used, what, a
png or a jpg probably?

926
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,480
We used a jpg.

927
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,780
If you're curious, an excessive
answer to your question

928
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,404
is a jpg is generally used for
photographs, because it supports

929
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:21,500
millions of colors or 24-bit color.

930
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,930
A gif is generally used for, like,
internet memes these days-- animations,

931
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,810
like animated gifs.

932
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:32,320
But it happens to use a smaller color
palette, only 256 possible colors,

933
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,230
but it supports
transparency and animation.

934
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:40,330
And then there's png, which supports
transparency and more colors

935
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,300
but not animation.

936
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,133
So it's a trade-off.

937
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:44,144


938
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,060
So adding a gif, though,
would be functionally

939
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,396
equivalent to adding a png or a jpg.

940
00:42:48,396 --> 00:42:49,110
Yeah.

941
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,550
Image source equals.

942
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,590
So something else.

943
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:57,288
Let's come up with something that
we sent to Victoria to do here.

944
00:42:57,288 --> 00:42:59,209
AUDIENCE: Add buttons for a form.

945
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,000
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

946
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,179
So add buttons for a form.

947
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,470
And we'll do that one together.

948
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,220
So that'll be a perfect segue
right after this challenge.

949
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,357
Anything else?

950
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:11,440
What might you like to do?

951
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,040


952
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,516
The web feels very underwhelming
if this is all we can do.

953
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:18,140
AUDIENCE: Change the color of the text.

954
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,500
DAVID J. MALAN: Change the what?

955
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,666
AUDIENCE: Color of the text.

956
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,311
DAVID J. MALAN: Change color of text.

957
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:22,810
All right.

958
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,790
So, let's do this.

959
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,209
Just again so that you're not, just
by rote, doing exactly what I'm doing,

960
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:29,500
I'm going to turn on music
for maybe five minutes here.

961
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,450
You're welcome to use Google.

962
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,130
You're welcome to ask me, and
I'll whisper a hint in your ear.

963
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,171
You're welcome to look
over on other's shoulders.

964
00:43:35,171 --> 00:43:37,340
But solve just one of these problems.

965
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,190
But we'll do the last one, the
forms one, if we could, together.

966
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,790
So five minutes to solve
any one of these problems

967
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,780
using Google, intuition, or any
other means available to you.

968
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,630
[MUSIC PLAYING]

969
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,130
All right.

970
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,838
No worries if you want
to keep tinkering,

971
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:53,880
but I'll spoil a couple
of these answers.

972
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,986
So the first suggestion from
Victoria was to make text bigger.

973
00:43:57,986 --> 00:43:59,360
So there's a few ways to do this.

974
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,530
I've currently restored
my screen to this size,

975
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,310
though I've zoomed in
artificially just to see things.

976
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,470
And let's do this.

977
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,380
Let me go ahead and grab
some generic Latin text

978
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:19,540
just so we have something to work with.

979
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,715
So give me just one moment.

980
00:44:20,715 --> 00:44:21,840
I'll make three paragraphs.

981
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:53,430


982
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,930
OK.

983
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,560
This will be a better example.

984
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,840
So for the curious, in
my hello.html, I just

985
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,645
pasted three nonsensical
Latin paragraphs

986
00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:03,270
just so we have some text to work with.

987
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:06,720
And Victoria's goal was to
make some of the text bigger.

988
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,879
So I could, as before, go in here.

989
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:11,170
And let me do it the right way.

990
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,253
I'm going to have a link
tag that points to a file

991
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:20,560
called "styles.css," the relationship
of which is again "stylesheet."

992
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,221
And then I'm going to save that
and open up this "styles.css."

993
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:28,940
So, as before, I have the
ability in this CSS file

994
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,569
to actually override the default
aesthetics of a web page,

995
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:33,860
and the default aesthetics,
of course, are pretty dull.

996
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,943
It's sort of normal font size, black
text, white background, and so forth.

997
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,440
So suppose I want to make
all of this text bigger.

998
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,460
I could do a few things.

999
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,750
In my styles.css file, I
could say, you know what,

1000
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:46,950
apply the following to
the body of my page.

1001
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,390
Go ahead and make the
font size 24 points,

1002
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,130
which is a number I might
use in Microsoft Word.

1003
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:57,620
Let me go back to my web
page here and reload,

1004
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,640
and you can see that
it's already much bigger.

1005
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,223
And we can get a little crazy,
just like we can on a desktop--

1006
00:46:02,223 --> 00:46:03,670
make it 96 points.

1007
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,950
Reload.

1008
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:07,610
And it's getting a little
unwieldy at this point.

1009
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:09,500
But I could be a little more precise.

1010
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,530
Instead of applying this
stylesheet to the body of my page,

1011
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:21,740
what else might I apply it to instead,
what other tag that might still

1012
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,445
function in the same way?

1013
00:46:25,445 --> 00:46:26,444
AUDIENCE: The p tag?

1014
00:46:26,444 --> 00:46:27,360
DAVID J. MALAN: P tag.

1015
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,350
So the head wouldn't be
correct, because the head,

1016
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:31,300
you can't actually
control the aesthetics of.

1017
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,700
There's either text there or not.

1018
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,760
But the p tag-- I can dive in a little
deeper, so to speak, to the paragraph

1019
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,350
tags.

1020
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:41,600
And even though there are three,
that's perfectly fine, because in CSS,

1021
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,900
when I just say "p," this
means apply the following

1022
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,300
to any tag that matches this
selector, the selector just

1023
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,430
being the name of the tag.

1024
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,350
So wherever you see a
"p," apply the font size,

1025
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:55,222
and let's make it more
reasonable again-- 24 point.

1026
00:46:55,222 --> 00:46:56,930
And you know what,
just for good measure,

1027
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,810
let's make the color
red just for the moment.

1028
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,740
And now if I reload, now we
see three ugly paragraphs.

1029
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,180
But now suppose that I'm sort
of-- I want the first paragraph

1030
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,210
to jump out at the user.

1031
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,150
I don't want to just increase
the font size of everything.

1032
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:16,105
And so I actually want to identify or
distinguish among these paragraphs.

1033
00:47:16,105 --> 00:47:18,730
So let's get rid of the red,
because that's just kind of tacky,

1034
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:23,885
and let's go ahead and make the
font size 12-point by default,

1035
00:47:23,885 --> 00:47:26,260
so that we're back to something
a little more reasonable.

1036
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,190
And now I just want to increase the
font size of the first paragraph.

1037
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,440
I can do this in a few
ways, but one way that's

1038
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,180
perhaps most instructional at the
moment is to do the following.

1039
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:43,280
Let me go ahead and say, this
paragraph has a unique ID of "first."

1040
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,000
I could call this anything I want.

1041
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,874
I could call this "foo"
or any other word,

1042
00:47:46,874 --> 00:47:49,290
but I'm going to give it some
semantically meaningful name

1043
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,320
like "first."

1044
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,790
This is the unique identifier,
the ID, for my first paragraph.

1045
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,360
What I can now do in my stylesheet
is be a little more precise.

1046
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,330
Instead of saying, apply
the following to the p tag,

1047
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,890
I can say the following--
apply the following,

1048
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:11,000
or select, the HTML element
that has a unique ID of "first."

1049
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,350
What do I want to apply to it?

1050
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:15,250
A font size of 24-point.

1051
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,640
So I have two selectors now.

1052
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,690
One makes all of the
paragraphs 12-point.

1053
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:24,960
But this one, especially since it comes
second-- it comes last in the file--

1054
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,090
this has a cascading effect.

1055
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:30,200
I've just made all of my
paragraph tags 12-point,

1056
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,350
but this now cascades and
overrides that for any elements

1057
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:38,800
in the page, any tag in the page whose
unique ID is quote unquote "first."

1058
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,720
And the hashtag in this context
just means "unique identifier."

1059
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,750
I don't put it in the HTML file.

1060
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,880
I, over here, just say
quote unquote "first."

1061
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,470
So let me reload.

1062
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:49,919
And now I see, ah, OK.

1063
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,710
I mean, it's not that
pretty, but it's kind

1064
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,600
of like the preface to a
book or something like that,

1065
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,100
where the first paragraph is bigger.

1066
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,933
Could be even more precise with
just the first letters, but at least

1067
00:48:57,933 --> 00:48:59,110
I've exercised more control.

1068
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:04,760
Now maybe-- maybe I want to do this
occasionally for whatever reason,

1069
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,010
and so I don't want this to
apply to just one HTML tag.

1070
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:15,110
Rather, let's say-- let's
also do the following.

1071
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:18,810
Class="import."

1072
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:23,970
Whereas an ID is used to uniquely
identify one thing, one tag,

1073
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:30,190
in your web page, a class is meant to be
used on any number of elements or tags

1074
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:30,950
on your web page.

1075
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:31,710
So it's reusable.

1076
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,090
An ID is not reusable.

1077
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,450
A class is reusable.

1078
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:37,830
And you know what, for whatever
philosophical reasons--

1079
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,180
I didn't finish my
thought-- I'm going to say

1080
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,300
that the first paragraph and the
second paragraph are important.

1081
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,600
So I'm going to apply the class called
"important," that, if I save my file

1082
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,510
and reload, has no
functional impact yet.

1083
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:53,780
But I've added some
metadata to the file,

1084
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,610
sort of something separate
from the core data of the file,

1085
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:02,300
so that now in my stylesheet, if I
instead say ".important"-- you know,

1086
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:07,110
anything that's important, I'm
going to make font-color, red--

1087
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,930
or rather not font-color, just color.

1088
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,930
There's inconsistencies
in CSS unfortunately.

1089
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,120
And reload.

1090
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,640
Now notice the first
two paragraphs are red

1091
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,880
but not the third, because I only
applied the class of "important"

1092
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,020
to the first two of those things.

1093
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,030
So in IDs, you have the ability
to specify very precisely.

1094
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:30,110
With classes, you have reusability.

1095
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:33,800
But in both cases, notice the
sort of good-design principle

1096
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:39,072
where I factored out all of the
aesthetics to my styles.css file.

1097
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:40,280
So there's no messiness here.

1098
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,490
There's no mention of red or
bold-facing or font size in this file.

1099
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:49,430
Rather I have semantically,
meaningfully characterized my data as,

1100
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,240
here is some important data.

1101
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,800
Here is some more important data.

1102
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,500
Moreover, here is the
"first" of my important data.

1103
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:01,050
So HTML is all about sort
of tagging, literally, words

1104
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:05,270
and paragraphs and constructs in your
page with these little hints, if you

1105
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,640
will, that you can
somehow leverage using

1106
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,880
other techniques like CSS in this way.

1107
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,760
So in answer to Victoria's question,
we can make text bigger in that way.

1108
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,380
There are so many other ways, but
the font tag-- open bracket "font"--

1109
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,770
is actually several years old.

1110
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:21,410
And this is the problem,
too, with relying only

1111
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,485
on online resources--
they tend to be outdated.

1112
00:51:23,485 --> 00:51:26,110
And indeed, that's been deprecated,
because the world realized,

1113
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:28,970
what does "font-size=7" mean?

1114
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:29,670
It doesn't.

1115
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,770
And so for many years and to
this day-- one of the side

1116
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:36,060
notes here is that it is actually
incredibly painful still sometimes

1117
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,900
to develop sites for the
web, because Microsoft

1118
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:44,220
and Google and Mozilla and
others often disagree as to how

1119
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,480
to interpret a specification like HTML.

1120
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,490
There is a rulebook for HTML that
generally says what each tag means.

1121
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:55,690
But sometimes it's left to the
implementation's discretion,

1122
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:57,290
Microsoft's discretion and Google.

1123
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:00,000
And so you'll very often
see on a website something

1124
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,954
looks different on a PC
than it does on a Mac,

1125
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:06,995
and that's really because,
at the end of the day,

1126
00:52:06,995 --> 00:52:08,891
they didn't test it
well on both platforms.

1127
00:52:08,891 --> 00:52:11,390
But it's also because reasonable,
smart people will disagree

1128
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,970
and companies will disagree, and so
one of the challenges of programming

1129
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,980
for the web or designing
things for the web

1130
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,700
is writing your website in a way
that works on every web browser.

1131
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,410
But even that's unreasonable, right?

1132
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:27,807
There are so many versions of so many
browsers out there that, at some point,

1133
00:52:27,807 --> 00:52:30,890
you also have to make a judgment call
and you have to decide as a company,

1134
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,082
especially for e-commerce-style
sites where you're

1135
00:52:33,082 --> 00:52:36,290
trying to use the latest and greatest
technologies to give a really good user

1136
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,110
experience.

1137
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:41,019
But some percentage of your users might
still be using Internet Explorer 6 or 7

1138
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:43,810
or 8, especially depending on the
country that they're coming from.

1139
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,760
And so very commonly
consulted is something

1140
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,920
like "web browser statistics."

1141
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,560
And if we go to-- let's see Wikipedia
and see how up-to-date this chart is

1142
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,320
if there is one.

1143
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,420
So here you can see
where browsers actually

1144
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:06,160
are, according to December 2015,
according to the US Government.

1145
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,170
Chrome is at 42% market share, followed
by IE largely in corporate settings

1146
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:14,490
or PC settings, of course,
followed by Firefox,

1147
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,440
then Safari, then Opera didn't
make the map here for some reason,

1148
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,210
and then Others.

1149
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:19,500
Maybe it's under Others.

1150
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:27,700
But more problematic than that is--
let's see if Wikipedia also has

1151
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:35,194
versions of browsers version--

1152
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:36,160


1153
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,190
Let's go to browser statistics.

1154
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:40,680
IE.

1155
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,030
Even that's not enough.

1156
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:44,854
Browser statistics.

1157
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:45,353
My version.

1158
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:48,980


1159
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,540
That's not going to be right.

1160
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,414
Let's see versions.

1161
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:54,830
Browser market share.

1162
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,110
Let's see if this comes up.

1163
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:57,610
OK.

1164
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:00,010
Now this is getting
a little more useful.

1165
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:04,870
So here, notice that we have all
different versions of browsers.

1166
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:09,887
And, my god, if you look-- Chrome
48, Chrome 47, Chrome 31, Chrome 45.

1167
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:12,970
I mean, browsers increasingly updated,
and sometimes some of those changes

1168
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:16,430
are significant in
terms of functionality.

1169
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:20,630
And so at some point, the
product managers or the engineers

1170
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:23,620
need to make a decision-- you
know what, only 1% of the world

1171
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,740
is still using IE 7.

1172
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,490
To hell with them.

1173
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,470
We're just not going to
support that browser.

1174
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,740
And what does it mean not to support?

1175
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,170
It might mean that buttons
don't work on your web page,

1176
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,050
or it might mean the
formatting is completely off.

1177
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,091
Or you might have to make
that same judgment call

1178
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:39,089
in mobile these days, where, we're
not going to support IOS 5 anymore.

1179
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:40,380
So people just have to upgrade.

1180
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,850
Or we're not going to support Cupcake
on Android OS for Android devices,

1181
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,629
because as the world-- as the
tech world wants to move forward,

1182
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:51,170
it kind of wants to drag the
world with it so that they don't

1183
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:53,295
have to continue to be
backwards compatible so they

1184
00:54:53,295 --> 00:54:54,920
can offer new and good features.

1185
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,878
This is indeed one of the reasons
why so many companies are rolling out

1186
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:01,440
automatic updates and sort of forcing
the latest versions of software on us.

1187
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,010
And even companies
like Apple will sort of

1188
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,280
force you almost or compel
you in terms of market forces

1189
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,164
to buy a new phone because they just
won't update your old phone anymore.

1190
00:55:11,164 --> 00:55:13,330
So you miss out on the
latest and greatest features,

1191
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:17,520
because it's costly to them as a
company to maintain older, arguably

1192
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,330
inferior versions of software.

1193
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:23,660
But the net effect is that
we also suffer this as well.

1194
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,550
So let's take a look at just
a couple of final things here.

1195
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,740
Let's knock off real fast some of
those other bullets, if curious.

1196
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,440
So if you were trying to,
for instance, position

1197
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,420
the text on different sides of the
page, I'm going to do one quick way,

1198
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,360
but there's different
ways of doing this.

1199
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,610
Let me go ahead and eliminate--
simplify this as follows.

1200
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,330
Let me just go back to my
simple, simple paragraphs.

1201
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,760
Let me go back to my styles.css.

1202
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,040
And I'm just going to use the simple--
which you might have seen on Google

1203
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,430
or recall from earlier--
text-align right.

1204
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,220
And reload this page.

1205
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,470
Now everything seems
to be right-aligned,

1206
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,770
as you might see on the overhead here.

1207
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:04,470
We can make it look a little more
book-like, and we can say "justify"

1208
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:05,640
and reload.

1209
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,870
Now it's nice and square on both
sides, which is kind of nice.

1210
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,220
Another goal that we had here
was change color of text.

1211
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,650
So we saw that with my red text.

1212
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,630
And now add buttons for a form.

1213
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:19,390
So why don't we try to do exactly this?

1214
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:23,656
But first let me go to a site that
most of us use every day-- Google.

1215
00:56:23,656 --> 00:56:25,780
And let's take a look at
how Google actually works.

1216
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,821
But I'm going to do this.

1217
00:56:26,821 --> 00:56:31,930
First let me do it in-- yep,
let me go to Google first.

1218
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,530
I'm going to have to go
into Google Settings,

1219
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:40,660
because I want to disable
something called Instant Results.

1220
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,580
So you might have noticed in
Google these days-- let me go back

1221
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,850
and turn this on.

1222
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,900
So if I start searching
for "cats" like this,

1223
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:50,120
notice that not only do
I get auto-complete up

1224
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:54,520
top, all of a sudden, the page itself
seems to change pretty quickly as well,

1225
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,750
and that's Google using a language
called JavaScript trying to be helpful.

1226
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,540
But unfortunately, it kind
of messes up our discussion

1227
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,010
of what's actually happening
underneath the hood here.

1228
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:09,070
So I am just kind of quickly
turn off instant results.

1229
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,510
And I'm going to click Save.

1230
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,930
And now I'm going to open
that diagnostic toolbar that I

1231
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,150
keep opening under the Network tab.

1232
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:17,720
So let's do this.

1233
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,960
Let me-- whoops--
scroll this down a bit.

1234
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,410
And let me search for "cats."

1235
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,790
And now notice-- actually,
this is a good opportunity

1236
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:28,840
to discuss for a moment.

1237
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,460
Notice the moment I type-- stop it.

1238
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,250
Stop it.

1239
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:35,790
OK.

1240
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:40,870
Notice the moment I type the letter
C, watch the bottom of the screen.

1241
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:48,600
A- T- S. What does the bottom
of this screen, my Network tab,

1242
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:53,320
suggest is happening each
time I type a letter?

1243
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,700
Unfortunately, the frog is very
distracting today or the shamrock

1244
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,339
or whatever he is.

1245
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:01,880
What was happening each time I typed?

1246
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,230
And let me clear the
buffer and type it again.

1247
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,580
So-- whoops.

1248
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:13,280
Every time I type a letter, C- A- T--
so a new row obviously keeps appearing.

1249
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,530
What does each of those rows represent,
based on what we've seen and discussed

1250
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,339
thus far?

1251
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:18,130
AUDIENCE: A search?

1252
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:21,770
DAVID J. MALAN: A search, or
more generically, an HTTP request

1253
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,125
from my browser to server.

1254
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:29,090
Well, why is my browser making an HTTP
request every time I type a letter?

1255
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,502
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1256
00:58:30,502 --> 00:58:33,210
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, it's giving
me these auto-complete results.

1257
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,190
Like, where do these
search results come from?

1258
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:38,120
Well, every time I type a
letter, Google sends more

1259
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,460
and more and more of
the word I'm typing.

1260
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,040
Why?

1261
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,540
Because they want to give me a
better and better, better suggestion,

1262
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,880
a list of suggestions, for what word
I'm trying to actually complete.

1263
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,030
So this is to say literally every
character you type into Google

1264
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:56,900
is being sent, ultimately in
bulk, but also sometimes one

1265
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,620
at a time in order to implement
these auto-complete features when

1266
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,000
the data is, of course, on the web.

1267
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,780
Now, let's take a look at what actually
happens when I click Google Search.

1268
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,420
And then we'll leverage this ourselves.

1269
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:15,320
So if I scroll down now to the very
first request that just happened.

1270
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,130
Notice the following.

1271
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:25,550
It was sent to a fairly long URL--
https://www.google.com/search?

1272
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,100
and then a whole bunch of stuff.

1273
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,620
Let's see this actually now
in the browser tab itself.

1274
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,310
Let's get rid of the toolbar here.

1275
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,140
Here's the page of search results.

1276
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,790
And notice here's the URL.

1277
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,430
Now, you can probably guess
what's going on here in part.

1278
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:39,090
So first of all, a definition.

1279
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,570
This apparently is the destination
where the form is submitted.

1280
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,910
So when I typed in the
words "cats" and hit Enter,

1281
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:48,460
apparently Google sent
my text input to this URL

1282
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,770
that I've highlighted
there, slash search.

1283
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:56,530
Turns out, in a URL, anything that
happens after a question mark is,

1284
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:01,270
as we keep saying, a key-value pair
that was typed into the form or somehow

1285
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:04,500
transmitted from the
browser to the server.

1286
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,180
So any time you type input
into a form on the web

1287
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,000
and it's sent as we've
been discussing, via a get,

1288
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,400
one of these virtual
envelopes, the contents

1289
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,510
of that envelope-- yes, keep
getting stuffed physically

1290
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:19,010
into the envelope in class
today, but technologically

1291
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:21,110
it's actually put in the URL.

1292
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,940
So in fact, let me sift through this.

1293
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,010
Where do you see user input?

1294
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:27,490
Where do you see something
that I myself typed up here?

1295
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:32,100


1296
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,491
Yeah, so "cats."

1297
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:33,990
Right?

1298
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:36,380
So let me distill this
into something simpler.

1299
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,917
I'm going to delete everything about
this URL that I don't understand,

1300
01:00:39,917 --> 01:00:42,250
and I'm just going to leave
it as this-- /search?q=cats.

1301
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:45,640


1302
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,890
We'll see where q
comes from in a moment,

1303
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:51,220
but that feels like the minimum
amount of information that I provided.

1304
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,050
And now I'm going to hit Enter.

1305
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,520
And notice it still works.

1306
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,950
We still get back a whole bunch of cats.

1307
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,340
So Google is fancier
than this these days.

1308
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,934
It's 2016, not 1999.

1309
01:01:01,934 --> 01:01:04,600
So there's other stuff that my
browser is sending to the server.

1310
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,100
But this is minimally
all that's necessary.

1311
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,380
So what's going on?

1312
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:14,320
Well, first let me go ahead and go
back to Cloud9 and let me go ahead

1313
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,620
and close my tabs earlier.

1314
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,230
And I'll do this on my
own just for a moment.

1315
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,730
I'm going to go ahead
and create new file.

1316
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:23,739
And I'm going to save it as google.html.

1317
01:01:23,739 --> 01:01:26,280
And I'm going to very quickly--
I'm going to steal, actually,

1318
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,510
some of this text just to save time.

1319
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,610
I'm going to paste this in here.

1320
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:33,850
I'm not going to bother with
any stylization this time.

1321
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:38,340
We're going to call this "My Google."

1322
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,230
And I'm going to get rid
of everything in the body.

1323
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,740
And I'm going to do the following.

1324
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,690
Let me zoom in.

1325
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:50,620
Form action-- and as I briefly mentioned
earlier-- whoops-- as I briefly

1326
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:54,130
mentioned earlier, the action of a
form is where you send the data to.

1327
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,620
So google.com/search.

1328
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:59,390
And the method I want to use
can be one of two things.

1329
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:02,870
It can either be "get," as we keep
discussing, or it can be "post."

1330
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,340
For now, the fundamental
difference is, if you use "get,"

1331
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:09,590
all of the information that the
user provides gets sent in the URL.

1332
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:13,530
That is great for things like search
engines and a few other applications,

1333
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:17,080
but in what circumstances would
you not want to fill out a form

1334
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:21,620
and have the information end up the
URL, like in your browser's address bar?

1335
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:25,470


1336
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:26,605
What kind of forms do you--

1337
01:02:26,605 --> 01:02:27,480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1338
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,450
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, like what?

1339
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:29,270
AUDIENCE: Passwords.

1340
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,936
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, so you log
in to Facebook or some website.

1341
01:02:31,936 --> 01:02:34,395
That's user input from
a form, a text box,

1342
01:02:34,395 --> 01:02:37,020
but you probably don't want it
showing up in the browser's URL.

1343
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,121
Why?

1344
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,870
I mean, maybe there are some
security implications on the network,

1345
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:44,830
but more-- like, more simply, what if
your roommate, your significant other,

1346
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,710
your kids, your spouse looks
through your browser history?

1347
01:02:47,710 --> 01:02:50,762
There is your password right
there in your browser's history.

1348
01:02:50,762 --> 01:02:52,220
That doesn't feel like good design.

1349
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,500
Or even more technically,
suppose you're trying

1350
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,180
to upload a photo to Flickr
or Facebook or wherever--

1351
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:03,010
that is user input, even though
it's a little more interesting-- how

1352
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:05,530
do I cram an image in the URL bar?

1353
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:06,730
You kind of sort of can't.

1354
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:07,396
You kind of can.

1355
01:03:07,396 --> 01:03:10,210
But, really, I'm hard-pressed
to imagine doing that.

1356
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:13,470
So I need another method for
uploading photos to a website,

1357
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,657
and that other method is called "post."

1358
01:03:15,657 --> 01:03:18,740
But for now, we'll just talk about
"get," which is the simpler of the two.

1359
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,100
It just puts all the
user input into the URL.

1360
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,830
So here's the form I'm creating.

1361
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,070
I want an input.

1362
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:24,820
And you know what?

1363
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,111
I'm going to take a guess here.

1364
01:03:26,111 --> 01:03:31,600
I'm going to recall my
input "q" for "query."

1365
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,970
And I think this is one of the
original designs, perhaps, from 1999.

1366
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:39,560
And then the type of this input
is just going to be "text."

1367
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,040
And then I'm going to have another input
that doesn't need a name, as we'll soon

1368
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,120
see, the type of which is "submit."

1369
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,070
And this is going to
give me a special button.

1370
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,320
And that's it.

1371
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,790
So let me go ahead and save this file.

1372
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:54,910
I'm going to go back to my
browser and go to google.html.

1373
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:56,140
Enter.

1374
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:59,680
And it's kind of sparse
to say the least.

1375
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,110
But let me go ahead
and search for "cats."

1376
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:06,510
And notice I'm currently
at this Cloud9 URL.

1377
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:09,240
But the moment I click this,
where do you hope I'll end up?

1378
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,160
AUDIENCE: Google.

1379
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,118
DAVID J. MALAN: Google.

1380
01:04:11,118 --> 01:04:12,740
So let's click Submit.

1381
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:15,200
And indeed I've re-implemented Google.

1382
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:15,700
Right?

1383
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,480
It's simpler.

1384
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,120
It's lighter.

1385
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,350
I mean, my code is clearly better than
theirs, from the mess we saw earlier.

1386
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:21,100
And you know what?

1387
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,610
I'm going to spice this up a little bit.

1388
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,860
I didn't mention this earlier.

1389
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,860
There are tags like H1, for Heading 1,
the most important heading in a page.

1390
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:30,570
"My Google," I'll call this.

1391
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:31,940
Let me reload.

1392
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,772
It's looking a little better already.

1393
01:04:33,772 --> 01:04:34,980
And, actually, you know what?

1394
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,430
I've already-- I lied.

1395
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:40,200
I said I wasn't going to style this,
but I'm going to style this like before.

1396
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:46,860
And my body is going to be,
let's say, text-align center.

1397
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,800
It's looking more like Google already.

1398
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,090
I need a line break, though,
for that Submit button.

1399
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,798
And it turns out, you
can use paragraphs,

1400
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:57,320
or you can more literally just say,
give me a line break here-- the br tag.

1401
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,319
And if I reload this, now it goes there.

1402
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:01,610
It's a little ugly, so I
could do multiple line breaks,

1403
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,310
but let's not get too greedy here.

1404
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:06,430
So now let's see if it works for "dogs."

1405
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,640
It seems to work for "dogs," as well.

1406
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,780
So what's the compelling takeaway here?

1407
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,600
One-- wasn't a huge leap to
introduce a few more tags,

1408
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,370
like the form tag in the input tag.

1409
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,120
But more fundamentally
is, all we're doing

1410
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,610
is leveraging our understanding
of HTTP and the fact

1411
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:24,900
that forms ultimately alter
what's in the URL of the browser,

1412
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,540
and so, therefore, we can
mechanically provide input to a server

1413
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:33,600
by making an HTML form and knowing
that the server understands HTTP,

1414
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,890
just like our body understands, like,
shaking my hand, that same protocol,

1415
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:40,920
and so we get back the response
that we ultimately expect.

1416
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,050
So let's try to do one
last thing now with mobile,

1417
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:47,052
and I'll make-- I'll add
this code to the slides.

1418
01:05:47,052 --> 01:05:49,760
So if you'd like to tinker, you
can certainly take it from there.

1419
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,551
But I'm going to go
ahead and do one thing.

1420
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:54,120
I'm going to go ahead and
open up my index page--

1421
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:59,030
my hello page as before, which
has a lot of this faux-Latin text,

1422
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:05,470
or meaningless Latin text, and has--
it looks like this at this font size.

1423
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:07,850
But let me go ahead and do this.

1424
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:09,300
I'm going to go into Cloud9.

1425
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,380
And you don't have to do this step.

1426
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,420
I'll just do it myself.

1427
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,890
I'm going to click Share.

1428
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:15,170
And this is a feature
just of Cloud9, whereby

1429
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:17,710
I can make my environment public.

1430
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:20,240
And just for the sake of
demonstration, let me do this.

1431
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,870
I'm going to make my application public.

1432
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:25,230
Notice it's warning me, am
I sure I want to do this,

1433
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:28,438
because this is going to make everyone
in the world, whether they're here now

1434
01:06:28,438 --> 01:06:33,560
or watching the video later on the
internet able to see what I see.

1435
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,440
But that's OK.

1436
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,870
I'm going to say "Done."

1437
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:42,080
And let me encourage you, if I did
this correctly-- let me test it first.

1438
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,590
Go ahead, if you don't mind--
in a browser on your computer,

1439
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:49,900
go to this URL, and hopefully
you'll see my Latin text.

1440
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,820
And to be clear, it's
running not on my laptop.

1441
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:53,610
It's in the cloud.

1442
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:58,120
It's on Cloud9, literally, but
I've made my workspace public

1443
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:03,450
so that anyone on the internet
can access my Latin home page.

1444
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:07,209
Go to the same URL on
your phone, if you could.

1445
01:07:07,209 --> 01:07:09,750
If it'll cost you, though, you
can just look over a shoulder.

1446
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:40,688


1447
01:07:40,688 --> 01:07:42,467
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1448
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:43,550
DAVID J. MALAN: I'm sorry?

1449
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:45,390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1450
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,710
DAVID J. MALAN: Just Latin words.

1451
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:48,210
That's all.

1452
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,250
But that's what you should see.

1453
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:49,875
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1454
01:07:49,875 --> 01:07:50,790
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.

1455
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:51,300
Yeah.

1456
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:51,540
OK.

1457
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,530
So can I hold up your
phone for just a moment?

1458
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:57,504
So, hopefully, if you're accessing
it, it should look almost unreadable.

1459
01:07:57,504 --> 01:07:59,920
It's still-- I mean, it's
unreadable because of the Latin.

1460
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,920
But it's also unreadable
for what other reason?

1461
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,775
Like, what displeases you about this?

1462
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:04,650
AUDIENCE: It's small.

1463
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,420
DAVID J. MALAN: It's super, super small.

1464
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:07,920
So how could we fix this?

1465
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,730
It's super, super small
on Victoria's phone

1466
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,400
and, if you've pulled
it up yourself, probably

1467
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,660
small on your phone as well, unless you
have accessibility settings enabled.

1468
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,530
What's that?

1469
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,497
You could just pinch and
zoom, which is workable,

1470
01:08:18,497 --> 01:08:20,330
but then you only see
a few words at a time.

1471
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:20,859
So wait a minute.

1472
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:21,720
I know how to fix this.

1473
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,219
Right?

1474
01:08:22,219 --> 01:08:26,130
I could use CSS, and I could change the
font size from 12-point to 24-point.

1475
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:29,020
But the side effect of that,
of course, is going to be now,

1476
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,630
on a desktop or a laptop,
now the text is twice as big.

1477
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,810
And so it would kind of be nice
to distinguish between devices,

1478
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,840
and it turns out there
are ways of doing that.

1479
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,590
There are several
different ways, in fact,

1480
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:44,189
whereby using CSS and fancier features
that we won't go into in great detail,

1481
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:46,960
you can essentially query
the browser and say,

1482
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,550
if your screen is smaller than this
many pixels, use this font size.

1483
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:55,180
If your screen is bigger than this
many pixels, use this other font size.

1484
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:57,080
You can be even fancier still.

1485
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,140
If you've ever visited a
web page that, on a desktop,

1486
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:04,404
has a big menu maybe off to the
side, and then all of the content

1487
01:09:04,404 --> 01:09:07,029
is to the side of that menu--
that's kind of a common paradigm.

1488
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:09,670
Menu on left, content
on right, or vice versa.

1489
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:13,569
Doesn't really work on mobile when your
screen is only this many pixels wide.

1490
01:09:13,569 --> 01:09:16,233
So more common on mobile is,
your menu will suddenly get

1491
01:09:16,233 --> 01:09:18,399
collapsed, and you have to
click a button to see it,

1492
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,404
or the website will put the menu
above it and put the content below it.

1493
01:09:22,404 --> 01:09:24,779
And you can implement these
things in multiple ways, too.

1494
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:28,340
You can ask your programmers,
hey, team, any time

1495
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:34,450
you see an HTTP request from an Android
device, a Microsoft device, a Google

1496
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:39,930
device, an Apple device, use this
font size and use this menu layout,

1497
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:42,670
or else use this default bigger layout.

1498
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:45,410
Now, using what
fundamental technique today

1499
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:48,529
could the engineers use
to know whether it's

1500
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:53,660
an iPhone, an Android phone, a laptop,
a desktop visiting the company's server?

1501
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,310
Wherein do they get that information?

1502
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,080
AUDIENCE: Header?

1503
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,740
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, the HTTP header.

1504
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:01,714
So every HTTP request coming from
their customers to their servers

1505
01:10:01,714 --> 01:10:03,880
include, inside that virtual
envelope, a whole bunch

1506
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,260
of HTTP headers, one of which is
the browser and the operating system

1507
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:10,290
even, if you care to
that level of detail.

1508
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,790
Now, it's a cryptic-looking string, but
there exists software that will just

1509
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:18,530
simplify that, and you can just ask
in programming code-- PHP, Java, C++,

1510
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:23,650
whatever-- what phone is this--
what device is this user using?

1511
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:27,501
And then you can say, show them this
version of the website if it's a phone.

1512
01:10:27,501 --> 01:10:30,250
Show them this version of the
website if it's a laptop or desktop.

1513
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,316
But you don't even need
server-side complexity.

1514
01:10:32,316 --> 01:10:33,940
You can do even the simplest of things.

1515
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:34,815
I'm going to do this.

1516
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:38,995
I'm going to go ahead into
my Cloud9 environment,

1517
01:10:38,995 --> 01:10:41,370
and I'm going to add a tag
that you saw in Google before.

1518
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:42,770
It's called the metatag.

1519
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:45,520
And I never remember this one, so
I'm going to transcribe it here.

1520
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,552
Meta name="viewport" and then
content="width=device width,intital

1521
01:10:50,552 --> 01:11:02,060
scale=1" and that's it.

1522
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:06,230
So it might as well be
like a magical incantation.

1523
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:11,300
It's not all that clear, but this has
something to do with the viewport,

1524
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:15,070
and the viewport is just the body of a
web page, the rectangular region that

1525
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,690
defines most of the page.

1526
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,060
And this is just telling
the browser, you know what?

1527
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:22,589
Make the width of this page
effectively equal to the device width.

1528
01:11:22,589 --> 01:11:25,380
In other words, don't assume that
you have sort of unlimited space.

1529
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:29,920
Assume you only have as much
space as the device itself is big.

1530
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:34,454
And so now, if I reload this
in my browser, I see no change.

1531
01:11:34,454 --> 01:11:37,370
But if I did this correctly-- and
let me cross my fingers-- if you all

1532
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:42,920
reload your phones, do you
see a compelling change?

1533
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,620
Yeah, is that--

1534
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,067
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1535
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:45,900
DAVID J. MALAN: Yes.

1536
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:46,400
OK.

1537
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,850
So arguably more readable now?

1538
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:53,070
Still small, to be fair, but not
so tiny as to be unmanageable.

1539
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:56,920
And I could certainly override this
further with CSS or on the server side,

1540
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,120
but increasingly what you're
seeing is more and more features

1541
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,900
being added to
client-side environments--

1542
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:06,530
JavaScript, as we'll discuss
tomorrow, CSS, and HTML-- so

1543
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,190
that all of these queries
can be done on the client

1544
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:11,910
so as to bother the
server a lot less and not

1545
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,530
to have to keep up with, for
instance, the constant onslaught

1546
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,210
of new operating-system
versions, new browser versions.

1547
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:20,190
You can just let the browser
ask the device, how big are you,

1548
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:22,890
and then make somewhat logical
decisions based on that.

1549
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,140
But we'll see more opportunities
for logical decisions

1550
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,223
tomorrow in the context
of a programming language.

1551
01:12:27,223 --> 01:12:29,800


1552
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,760
So, any questions, then,
on web development?

1553
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,130
Today is not web programming, per
se, since most everything we did

1554
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:38,370
was very aesthetic, if you will.

1555
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:41,750
There is no decision-making in
the code that we have written,

1556
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,990
and so that's why HTML is a markup
language, not a programming language.

1557
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:47,140
But tomorrow we'll take
a quick look, ultimately,

1558
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:49,340
at JavaScript, which is
an actual programming

1559
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:54,220
language that lets us do a bit more.

1560
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,800
Any questions?

1561
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,480
Well, let me propose two
opportunities optional for homework.

1562
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,900
One is-- these Cloud9
accounts won't expire.

1563
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,669
You're welcome to use
them to tinker with.

1564
01:13:04,669 --> 01:13:05,960
It's the free level of service.

1565
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,754
Realize that, if when creating
your workspace, you made it public,

1566
01:13:08,754 --> 01:13:11,670
that does mean that anyone on the
internet can see what you're typing.

1567
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:15,104
So maybe just consider
not embarrassing yourself

1568
01:13:15,104 --> 01:13:18,020
if you're putting your first web
page out there publicly accidentally,

1569
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:20,134
but no one's going to
know to look there anyway.

1570
01:13:20,134 --> 01:13:23,760
And two-- let me toss
up this URL as well,

1571
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,250
especially if you came in today a
little less comfortable than others,

1572
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,430
unsure what all this stuff means.

1573
01:13:30,430 --> 01:13:36,780
Realize that much more of this video,
which is both a good way to fall asleep

1574
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:39,380
and also to laugh while
doing so, also has

1575
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:44,300
a lot of societally interesting
and security-relevant discussions

1576
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,370
therein from John Oliver,
albeit a comedian.

1577
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:55,456
But if there are no further questions,
that brings us to the reception.

1578
01:13:55,456 --> 01:13:56,830
So why don't I turn on the music.

1579
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,610
There should be drinks
and snacks outside.

1580
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:00,220
I'm happy to mingle for as
long as folks would like,

1581
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:01,600
answer questions more one-on-one.

1582
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,330
But, otherwise, you're welcome
to take off at any point,

1583
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:05,740
and we'll see you again
tomorrow morning for a bit more.

1584
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,290
All right, thanks.

1585
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:10,428
